        What is Cryptography</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/codewheel.gif"
        align="right" border="1" hspace="5" width="217"
        height="213"></font><font size="2">Cryptography (from the
        Greek Krypto 'hidden' and Grafo 'written') is the study
        and implementation of techniques to hide information, or
        to protect it from being read. The information that is
        protected can be written text, electronic signals such as
        Morse, Telex or speech, or all kinds of digital
        information like computer files, e-mail messages or data
        transmissions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The unprocessed readable information is
        called plaintext or plain data. The process of making the
        information unreadable is called encryption or
        enciphering. The result of encryption is a ciphertext or
        cryptogram. Reversing this process and retrieving the
        original readable information is called decryption or
        deciphering. To encrypt or decrypt information, an
        algorithm or so-called cipher is used.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">How a cryptographic algorithm works, is
        controlled by a secret key, sometimes called password or
        passphrase (on crypto machines, the key is the setting of
        the machine). The key is known only to those who are
        authorized to read the information. Without knowing the
        key, it should be impossible to reverse the encryption
        process, or the time to attempt to reverse the process
        should required take so much time that the information
        would become useless.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Cryptanalysis or crypto-analysis is the
        study and analysis of existing ciphers or encryption
        algorithms, in order to assess their quality, to find
        weaknesses or to find a way to reverse the encryption
        process without having the key. Decryption without a key
        (often also without authorization) is a cryptanalytic
        attack, referred to as breaking or cracking a cipher.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">A cryptanalytic attack can exploit
        weaknesses in the algorithm or crypto device itself,
        exploit its implementation procedures, or try out all
        possible keys (a brute-force attack). In general, there
        are two types of attack: The ciphertext-only attack,
        where the cryptanalyst or attacker has access only to the
        ciphertext, and the known-plaintext attack, where the
        cryptanalyst has access to both ciphertext and its
        corresponding plaintext or assumed plaintext, to retrieve
        the corresponding key.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Cryptology comprises both cryptography
        (making) and cryptanalysis (breaking). The expressions
        'code', 'encoding' and 'decoding' are frequently used in
        cryptography. A code, however, is a simple replacement of
        information with other information, and doesn't use an
        algorithm. Generally, these are code books or tables that
        convert one value (letters, words or phrases) into
        another value (letter sequence, numerical value or
        special symbols). Cryptography, on the other hand, uses
        an algorithm (often a combination of fractioning,
        transposition and substitution) to manipulate the
        information. Although technically wrong, the expression
        'encoding' is often used to indicate encryption or
        enciphering and one should therefore look at the context
        in which such expressions are used.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">A Brief History</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">Ever since mankind has existed, people
        have had secrets, and other people have wanted to know
        these secrets. The earliest forms of cryptography were
        performed by pencil and paper, and of course were
        available only to those who had access to proper
        education. These classical ciphers were mainly
        transposition ciphers, which rearrange the letters in a
        message, and substitution ciphers, which replaced
        letters, groups of letters or words with other letters,
        groups or words. One of the earliest reported
        substitution ciphers was the Caesar cipher or Caesar's
        shift, in which the letters of the alphabet were replaced
        by the letters of a second alphabet that was shifted a
        fixed number of positions again the normal alphabet. It
        was named after Julius Caesar who used it to communicate
        with his generals during his military campaigns.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Cryptography was used to secure secret
        communications from military leaders, diplomats, spies
        and religious groups. Unfortunately, most of the early
        ciphers revealed statistical information which could be
        used to break them. As early as the 9th century, Arab
        mathematicians discovered frequency analysis and
        developed methods to break ciphers. This started the race
        between codemakers and codebreakers. Frequency analysis
        proved to solve many of the known ciphers, and it was
        only with the invention of the poly-alphabetic cipher by
        Leon Battista Alberti in the 15th century that codemakers
        were one step ahead of the codebreakers again.
        Poly-alphabetic ciphers like Vigenère use different sets
        of alphabets during the encryption process. For ages,
        these ciphers were considered to be unbreakable until
        Charles Babage in the 19th century developed the multiple
        frequency analysis techniques.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Cryptography was extensively used by
        governments to protect their diplomatic post. In the 18th
        century, all major countries in Europe started recruiting
        cryptologists to either protect their communication,
        mostly letters through postal services, or break the
        encrypted messages of other countries. These bureaus
        became known as the Black Chambers. Some of the most
        notorious Black Chambers were the Austrain Geheime
        Kabinets-Kanzlei in Vienna, the French Cabinet Noir and
        later the British Room 40, notorious for their great
        skill in intercepting and decrypting all kinds of
        military and diplomatic post. Cryptography soon became an
        important weapon in politics and in the many wars in
        Europe. By the end of the 19th century important steps
        were made in the development of cryptography. Auguste
        Kerckhoffs was one of the most important men to change
        cryptography from a dark art into a science, based on
        mathematics. It was Kerckhoffs who stated the fundamental
        principle that encryption should not depend on the
        secrecy of the system - which sooner or later would be
        compromised - but should solely depend on the secrecy of
        the key.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Many new pencil-and-paper ciphers or
        hand ciphers were developed and used during the First
        World War. Among them were ADFGVX, Playfair and Double
        Transposition. All of them were based on transposition,
        substitution and fractioning of letters. One important
        invention was the one-time pad encryption for Telex
        traffic by Gilbert Vernam in 1917. He realised that when
        a Telex signal is mixed with a truly random key with the
        same length as the message, the message would be
        unbreakable. Pencil-and-paper versions of his invention
        soon followed. With the rise of wireless communication,
        the need for secure communications for both military as
        civilian use grew exponential. The impractical and
        time-consuming hand ciphers could not keep up with the
        growing demand and this lead to the development of cipher
        machines.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">After the First World War, two types of
        machines dominated the market. The electromechanical
        rotor machines such as the German Enigma and Siemens
        &amp; HalskeT-52, and the British Typex, and the fully
        mechanical pin-and lug machines like the Hagelin series.
        Although machines took over most of the work,
        pencil-and-paper based hand ciphers still remained in use
        for short-time tactical purposes, where the time to
        cryptanalyse them would render the tactical information
        useless. For example, the secure Double Transposition
        hand cipher was used until the end of the Second World
        War by both Allied an Axis forces. Some pencil-and-paper
        ciphers such as one-time pads were even used during the
        Cold War for clandestine operations by intelligence
        services.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">All major countries realized the
        importance of intelligence gathering and new
        organizations saw the light. In Britain, Room 40 was
        reorganized into the Government Communications &amp;
        Cipher School (GC&amp;CS), which played a decisive role
        during the Second World War. Amongst their most famous
        cryptologist were Alastair Denniston, Dilly Knox, John
        Tiltman. In the United States, the Signal Intelligence
        Service (SIS) and the Communications Security section of
        the Office of Naval communications (OP-20-G) were the
        most important code breaking organisations with legendary
        cryptologists such as William Friedman and Meredith
        Gardner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Second World War lead to improved
        cipher machines like the American SIGABA and SIGCUM, and
        the German Lorenz SZ-40 and Schlusselgeraet 41. To break
        the enormous amount of encrypted message traffic the
        codebreaker had to build new, automated machines, which
        lead directly to the development of the first digital
        computers. In Bletchley Park, Max Newton and Tommy
        Flowers developed the Colossus, a digital programmable
        computer to break the Lorenz SZ-40/42 messages. This was
        the first step in the evolution of cryptography towards
        the new computer age. However, new improved
        electro-mechanical cipher machines such as the KL-7,
        Fialka M-127 and Hagelin CX-52 were designed and remained
        in service until the 1980s, when the digitalisation
        really broke through.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It was Claude Elwood Shannon who laid
        the foundations for modern cryptography in 1948 with his
        famous Information Theory. The development of electronics
        and digital computers after the Second World War made it
        possible to create encryption algorithms, far more
        complex than before. The new computer algorithms were no
        longer based on the simple substitution, transposition
        and fractioning of letters and words, but on a large
        number of complex operations on data bits. One of the
        first block ciphers - encryption performed on blocks of
        data bits - was the Lucifer cipher, designed by Feistel
        and Coppersmith for IBM, and based on what is known as a
        Feistel network. It was the predecessor of DES, the first
        ever cryptographic standard. However, the computer
        revolution did not only lead to better encryption
        systems, but also to faster and better codebreaking
        techniques. The race between codemakers and codebreakers
        continued as before. Absolute security was one of the
        reasons that one-time pad systems remained in use until
        the 1980s for Telex traffic and such, although the
        expensive and complex key distribution, a typical
        downside of one-time pad, made it only affordable to the
        military and diplomatic services. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Until the 1970s, the cryptologic
        community remained very closed and mainly controlled by
        government agencies. This changed drastically by the
        public release of DES, the Data Encryption Standard, and
        the RSA public-key Algorithm. Following Kerckhoffs
        principle, newly designed crypto algorithms were released
        into the public domain, to subject them to extensive
        academic research. The advantage was obvious. A very
        large open crypto community could assess new algorithms,
        discover weaknesses and propose improvements or
        disapprove the use of a weak algorithm. This lead to a
        'survival of the fittest' situation, resulting in quality
        encryption standards.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The most widely used symmetric
        algorithms today are the Advanced Encryptions Standard
        (AES), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA),
        Blowfish and Triple DES. Nevertheless, secret algorithms
        are still developed and used, mainly by government
        agencies. Another type of computer algorithms were stream
        ciphers. They were developed as an answer to the key
        distribution problem of long keys, as used in systems
        like one-time pad. Where a block cipher performs a
        cryptographic function on a fixed number of plain bits,
        the stream cipher produces a continuous stream of random
        values that is mixed with the plain bits. Some well known
        stream ciphers are RC4, SEAL and SOBER.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Another field of cryptography is
        message integrity and authentication. How can we be sure
        that the message that we receive is authentic and has not
        been tampered or modified? The solution is a Hash
        function, a special one-way function. Hash functions use
        a crypto algorithm, controlled by a secret key, to take
        an input and return a unique fixed-size string, which is
        called the hash value. This value is used to 'sign' the
        message. This unique value cannot be reproduced without
        the secret key. Therefore it is impossible to change the
        message content, since this would require the calculation
        of a new signature value, which is impossible without
        knowing the key. Meanwhile many different cryptographic
        hash functions are developed. MD5, SHA-2 and RIPEMD are
        some of the latest and most secure hash functions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The most important development for
        modern cryptography was public-key cryptography. Until
        1970, all encryption was based on symmetric-key
        algorithms. Both encryption and decryption are performed
        with the same key. Both sender and receiver of an
        encrypted message have to use the same key. The
        disadvantage of this system was a complex key
        distribution system with several security issues. The
        invention of the asymmetric-key algorithm by James Ellis
        was a revolution in the world of cryptography. With
        asymmetric-key cryptography, two keys are used. A public
        key for encryption only, and a secret private key for
        decryption. The public key cannot be used to decrypt the
        information. This solved the expensive and risky problem
        of secret key distribution.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">From now on, you could make your public
        key available to everyone. Everyone can encrypt his
        message, destined to you, with your public key, but only
        you, with your private secret key, can decrypt the
        message. There is no longer a need to share a secret key!
        James Ellis' invention at the Government Communications
        Headquarters (GCHQ), the successor of the GC&amp;CS,
        remained top secret. However, in 1976, Whitfield Diffie
        and Martin Hellman proposed an asymmetric-key algorithm,
        and in 1978, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman
        invented RSA, another public-key system. Because of their
        solution to the secret key distribution problem, the
        Diffie-Hellman and RSA algorithms are among the most
        widely used crypto algorithms in the world.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Public-key algorithms are based on the
        computational complexity problem. The Diffie-Hellman
        algorithm is based on the discrete logarithm problem and
        RSA is based on the problem of factorization of large
        primes. Asymmetric-key algorithms require large keys and
        heavy computation, which makes them suitable only for
        encryption of small amounts of data. Therefore, strong
        traditional symmetric algorithms often are used to
        encrypt information and the asymmetric-key is then used
        to encrypt the secret keys. One of the most popular
        implementations of this principle is Philip Zimmermanns
        PGP, which is a combination of powerful symmetric block
        ciphers, the practical public-key asymmetric cryptography
        and the message integrity of digital signatures by hash
        functions.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Cryptography Today</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">What has cryptography to do with you?
        Everything! Today, cryptography is embedded in all
        aspects of your life to protect your privacy. When you
        connect your computer to the Internet to browse, to
        e-mail, or login onto your favorite social network, that
        connection is secured by TLS (Transport Layer Security).
        The TLS protocol uses strong cryptography to prevent
        eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. And it's
        not only your personal computer that uses encryption. If
        we go shopping, our customer card is scanned and
        cryptography protects the personal data of the customers.
        If you pay with your bank card in a shop, or draw money
        from an ATM, the transaction is securely processed by
        your bank. Information on the chip of your ID card and
        health insurance card are encrypted. When you call
        someone with your mobile phone, your digitized voice is
        encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. The remote key of the
        central locking system of your car communicates with your
        car to generate unique keys, protected by cryptography.
        Let's put it this way: How would you like it when
        someone, let's say your life insurance broker, could
        simply use the Internet to read the computer files of
        your doctor? Or when someone could check your police
        record without authorization? What if your employer could
        check what you do with your money? Cryptography prevents
        people from illegally invading your privacy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The most important benefit of
        cryptography is indeed privacy. Today our lives are
        completely digitized. Nearly all your private information
        is stored in one of the many databases from the
        government, police, city services, banks, commercial
        holdings, health care services and so on. All this
        information can get exposed to unauthorized people. We
        need to stay in control of the technology that ensures
        our privacy. Cryptography protects the right to privacy
        and the right to communicate confidentially. Secure
        communications can protect one&#146;s intimate private
        life, his business relations, and his social or political
        activities. These basic rights are written in the
        constitution of many, but not all countries. Of course,
        it is illegal to use cryptography for criminal or
        terrorist purposes. This does not mean that the use of
        cryptography should be illegal. Just as with weapons, a
        knife or a crowbar, it is not because you could use these
        objects for illegal purposes that they should be regarded
        as illegal. It is useless to make cryptography illegal.
        Criminals simply don&#146;t care about the law. If you
        outlaw cryptography, only outlaws will have cryptography
        (read privacy).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">However, even the most liberal and
        democratic countries have laws that control the use of
        cryptography and some countries have stricter laws than
        others. Many governments are reluctant to permit the use
        of cryptography by their citizens because it limits the
        government&#146;s surveillance capabilities. The laws are
        often a balancing between the protection of the
        individual privacy and a nation&#146;s security or its
        the fight against crime. Democratic countries tend to
        permit cryptography for personal use and have legal
        mechanisms to bypass the right to privacy with a court
        order in case of a criminal investigation or a threat of
        the nation. The boundaries between lawful surveillance
        and state organized invasion of privacy is often a
        subjected to discussion, even in democratic countries.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Depending on the country, laws on
        cryptography can restrict specific types of cryptography
        partially or allow only government licensed systems,
        limit the strength of the encryption or demand key
        escrow. Some laws can force someone to hand over the
        decryption keys following a judicial warrant and there
        are laws that restrict the import or export of
        cryptographic software, equipment or knowledge, or even
        regard export of cryptography as weapons export. One
        might have no objection to his current government having
        the possibility to invade your privacy 'in case they
        really need to', and of course only when approved by the
        justice department. But governments change, and what you
        believe to be a democracy today, can be a totalitarian
