        </font><font size="2">TEMPEST and Secure Communications</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">Electronic communications should not
        only be efficient and reliable, but also secure. This
        means that it must be impossible for the adversary to
        intercept and read sensitive information. The most
        obvious solution is encryption, making the message
        unintelligible for anyone who eavesdrops on insecure
        communications channels. Cryptography has been used
        extensively since the early 20th century to protect the
        rapidly expanding military communications. However, in
        the 1940s it was discovered that, despite using secure
        encryption algorithms, the crypto equipment itself could
        unintentionally emanate signals that enable the adversary
        to read the communications. The answer to this threat was
        TEMPEST.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The codename TEMPEST (not an acronym
        but sometimes written out as Telecommunications
        Electronics Material Protected from Emanating Spurious
        Transmissions) refers to the whole of technical
        recourses, standards and regulations to protect
        communications equipment against unwanted radiation of
        signals that might be intercepted, analyzed and exploited
        by the adversary.</font></p>

                <td valign="top"><font size="2">During the Second
                World War, the U.S. Signal Corps encrypted
                high-level teletype communications with one-time
                tapes (OTT's). This system uses Vernam&#146;s
                original principle where a five-bit teletype
                signal is mixed with a key tape, containing
                random five-bit values. The system is quite
                simple but absolutely unbreakable, even with
                todays or any future technology. A famous example
                is the Washington-Moscow hotline. </font><p><font
                size="2">Bell Telephone provided the Signal Corps
                with the 131-B2 PYTHON mixer that combined the
                teleprinter output signal with the one-time
                tapes. The machine was also know as the as the
                AN/FGQ-1 or CSP-2599 in military nomenclature.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In 1943, Bell engineers
                discovered little spikes on the screen of an
                oscilloscope near a working one-time tape mixer.
                Upon further investigation, they discovered that
                the oscilloscope had picked up electrical
                signals, emitted by the one-time tape mixer. To
                their surprise, the spikes on the screen
                represented the readable unencrypted five-bit
                signal. They could read the plain text directly
                from their oscilloscope!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">It was obvious that these
                undesirable interference signals arose from the
                crypto equipment, even before the signal was
                encrypted. Bell Labs informed the Signal Corps
                about this dangerous vulnerability in their
                crypto system. The Signal Corps, however, met
                Bell&#146;s findings with a lot of skepticism and
                believed that it would be impossible for an
                adversary to intercept these tiny electrical
                spikes in operational conditions. They answered
                that, and I quote, &#147;we can&#146;t bring our
                cryptographic equipment to a screeching halt
                based on a dubious and esoteric laboratory
                phenomenon. If this is really dangerous, prove
                it.&quot;</font></p>

        </div><p><font size="2">Bell Labs was assigned a building
        at Varick Streek, New York, right across the Signal Corps
        crypto center. During an improvised test they recorded
        signals over a one hour period. Within three hours, the
        engineers succeeded in recovering 75 percent of the plain
        text of so-called encrypted traffic, and this without any
        physical connection to the crypto center. Shocked by the
        results, the Signals Corps asked Bell to examine the
        problem and to modify the 131-B2 mixer.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Searching for Solutions</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">After six months, Bell Labs had
        identified three phenomena. The first problem were small
        radio emissions of electrical pulses, carrying at least
        half a mile, caused by electrical contacts in relays. The
        second issue was induction. Some of the emitted pulses
        were picked up by the communication lines and traveled
        more than a mile on those lines. The third phenomenon was
        the radiation of magnetic fields, originating from coils
        in relays, reaching some 30 feet but virtually impossible
        to suppress. To make it even worse, all the different
        types of radiation occurred on a very wide frequency
        spectrum.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The solutions to suppress these
        unwanted signals were shielding to contain the emitted
        signals, filtering to block induction on lines and
        masking the remaining signals by adding interference
        signals. The latter of course proved unacceptable for the
        Radio Advisory Committee. The modified 131-A1 mixer was
        fitted with various filters and completely encapsulated,
        causing heat dissipation problems. The machine was very
        heavy and difficult to operate and maintain. The Signal
        Corps turned down the impractical monster and opted for
        the only other solution: they ordered communications
        centers to be located within a controlled free zone of at
        least 100 feet. Case closed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Seven years later the problem was long
        forgotten when it was rediscovered in 1951 by the CIA
        during tests with the very same 131-B2 mixer. They were
        able to intercept plain text half a mile along a
        communications line. The CIA asked the American Forces
        Security Agency (AFSA) if they were interested in this
        problem. Of course they were. AFSA solved the induction
        problem but some emissions remained. This resulted in the
        first AFSA radiation policies, providing recommendations
        about how to securely operate crypto devices. With too
        small a budget, NSA took over the research to eliminate
        the annoying signals from its precursor AFSA .</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">More problems surfaced. Acoustic
        radiation of crypto devices provided information that
        could be exploited and electrical motors and coils in
        crypto machines and teleprinters caused voltage
        variations on the electrical net, revealing additional
        intelligible information. By then, five problems were
        identified and emission distances kept increasing. This
        initiated a race between the engineers who searched for
        solutions to contain the problem and the analysts who
        found new ingenious ways to intercept the persistent
        signals at even larger distances. They were criticized
        for finding methods to increase the distance and were
        asked to focus on decreasing the distance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Unfortunately, another even more
        serious problem surfaced: crypto equipment, connected to
        radio transmitters, emitted very weak plain text signals.
        These signals were picked up by the nearby transmitter
        and modulated onto the transmitted radio waves. The plain
        text piggy-backed on the transmitter&#146;s powerful
        radio waves, making it possible to filter out and read
        the plain text at distances of tens or hundreds of miles.
        This was by far the most serious security issue.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">From Solutions to Policies</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">In 1956, after years of research and
        numerous unsuccessful experiments, the Navy Research
        Laboratory came up with the first major breakthrough.
        Instead of trying to filter and shield the annoying
        signals, they simply reduced the cause of the problem. By
        running the critical components on a much lower voltage
        and replacing electromechanical components by transistors
        and semi-conductors they reduced the amplitude of the
        signal considerably or eliminated it completely. A signal
        with an amplitude of 2 volts simply doesn&#146;t carry as
        far as a 120 volts signal, and switching currents with
        transistors avoided the sparking of relay contacts.</font></p>

                <td valign="top"><font size="2">NSA took over the
                technique of filtering and lower voltages for all
                new one-time tape mixers. The emission distances
                were reduced from half a mile to a mere 20 feet.
                All new equipment, from crypto machines to
                teleprinters and other on-line devices were now
                developed with the gained knowledge.</font><p><font
                size="2">The first extensive regulations on
                TEMPEST were drafted by the Military
                Communications Board (MCB) in 1958. The
                classification of the various problems and
                recommendations were finally put on paper and
                generally accepted. Canada and the U.K. followed
                in 1959 and the first real Communications
                Security or COMSEC plan was written out the same
                year. The consequences of the COMSEC policies
                were far-reaching.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Many insecure devices,
                buildings and procedures were identified and
                security measures were taken. Technical test and
                standards for communications equipment followed.
                The policies regarding TEMPEST and COMSEC were
                finally implemented in 1966 and a TEMPEST
                laboratory for non-crypto equipment was founded
                in 1970.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">On the right you see a fine
                example of mid 1960&#146;s TEMPEST design. The
                KW-7, a second generation teletype encryption
                unit, was fully filtered, shielded and operated
                on low voltage electronics. In front of the
                machine, on the left, is one of its 12 cards,
                carrying 21 small modules. Each module contained
                several transistors, diodes and passive
                components. These &quot;Flyball&quot; modules
                were the precursor of todays integrated circuits
                or IC&#146;s. The KW-7 was quite an improvement
                over the electro-mechanical 131-B2 in its wooden
                cabinet.</font></p>

        </div><p><font size="2">These technical improvements and
        regulations came none too soon. Already in the early
        1950s, the Soviets published a comprehensive set of
        regulations on suppressing signals from teleprinters and
        communications equipment. These regulations were much
        stricter than generally accepted in their industry. The
        Soviets clearly recognized the potential hazards of those
        annoying signals and were rightly worried. Undoubtedly,
        they also understood the potential of intercepting these
        signals from early on. Whether they also exploited the
        ignorance of their adversaries remains hidden in the
        Soviet intelligence archives.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Today, many security related
        communications devices are TEMPEST designed. Probably the
        largest TEMPEST object on earth is the massive NSA
        building at Fort Meade, encased in copper meshing to
        shield it from eavesdropping. TEMPEST now resorts under
        the broader EMSEC (Emission Security). Today&#146;s
        electronics provide new possibilities to suppress
        unwanted radiation but also enable the development of new
        sophisticated and very sensitive equipment to intercept
        those signals. The development and operation of secure
        communications equipment will always remain a technical
        challenge.</font></p>
