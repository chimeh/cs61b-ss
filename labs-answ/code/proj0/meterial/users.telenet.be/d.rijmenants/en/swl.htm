                listening is the reception of public broadcast or

                1.8 to 30 MHz (160m to 10m band), also called SW
                (shortwave) or HF (High Frequency) bands. The
                combination of receiver, antennas and propagation
                make SWL an exciting and often technical
                challenging hobby.</font><p><font size="2">This

                with a good digital shortwave receiver in the
                price category of 200 Euro or $250, how to

                little technical skills you can build the

        </div><p><font size="2">Most SWL's also log the stations
        they received. This way, they can easily analyze when and
        at what frequencies they can search for a particular
        station or radio signals from a particular country. Each
        new station or country is another trophy for their SWL
        log. Many SWL's also send signal reports, called SQL
        cards, to the stations they captured. By reporting the
        quality and readability of the signal at their location,
        they help the ham radio amateurs or broadcast stations to
        assess the quality and performance of their equipment and
        antennas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Radio amateurs and some broadcast
        stations respond to these SQL cards by sending their own
        QSL card to confirm the signal report. These SQL cards
        come in all kinds of own designs and colors, but all
        carry a standard formatted signal report (RST or SINPO).
        SWL's and ham amateurs often collect SQL cards from all
        over the world. Amateur radio organizations offer free
        world-wide SQL postal service to their ham or SWL
        members. You might consider joining a local amateur radio
        organization. I'm a ham operator (ON3DZ) and SWL
        (ONL11714) myself at the </font><a
        href="http://uba.be/en/home" target="_blank"><font
        size="2">UBA Belgian Amateur Radio Society</font></a><font
        size="2"> and whenever I get the change and time, I love
        to surf the radio waves!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">For many ham radio amateurs, listening
        to shortwave stations was their first acquaintance with
        amateur radio and a first step towards their ham license.
        Indeed, SWL is an ideal introduction into ham radio
        because you get familiar with the ham bands, radio
        propagation and procedures. However, there are just as
        many SWL's who never become radio amateur but continue to
        enjoy discovering the world through radio waves all their
        live. On the other end, many radio amateurs continue to
        SWL once in a while, all their live, to sharpen their
        receiving skills or test new antenna designs.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Selecting a Receiver</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">There are many shortwave receivers on
        the market. Unfortunately, many of them are not suitable.
        Don't buy those 50 Euros or 60 dollar analogue or digital
        world receivers that promise you the world. They don't!
        If you're lucky, you will capture a few strong shortwave
        broadcast stations and some medium or long wave stations.
        That's it. So, what are the requirements for a decent
        shortwave radio?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">You need a digital tuned shortwave
        receiver with full coverage of the HF shortwave bands
        from 1.8 to 30 MHz. Full coverage means that you must be
        able to tune anywhere in the whole frequency range (many
        shortwave radio's only tune broadcast bands and skips
        utility and amateur bands). If you intend to SWL on ham
        stations, it is essential that, apart from AM, you have
        SSB (single side band - both LSB and USB). You should be
        able to set the frequency manually, both from its
        keyboard and from a rotating tuning dial that includes a
        fine tuning function. Without SSB and fine tuning it is
        impossible to capture ham stations, since they do not use
        the normal AM signal. Its memory - the more the better -
        should store frequency, fine tuning and mode (AM, LSB,
        USB). A gain control, to amplify weak signals or
        attenuate over-modulation or heavy interference, and DSP
        (Digital Signal Processing) are definitely recommended
        and sync detection would be really nice.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Finally, your receiver must absolutely
        carry an external antenna connection (without, you cannot
        connect a balanced line or transformer). The laws of
        physics regarding radio waves and antennas are simple:
        you need large antennas for shortwave (much larger than
        your FM radio needs to capture music stations) and
        without external connection your antenna options are very
        limited. Don't despair, it's easy to construct simple
        wire antennas that greatly improve reception! We will
        explain all of this later on. There are several excellent
        shortwave receiver on the market for a reasonable price
        from manufacturers like Sony, Sangean, Grundig or Degen.
        Of course, you could also buy professional receivers from
        companies like Icom, Elecraft, Yaesu or Kenwood, but this
        will quickly bring you in the +1.000 price category. It's
        not my goal to promote one specific radio or brand and
        it's up to you to select one.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">For SWL, I personally use the Sangean
        ATS 909X which is an excellent and well build radio with
        all required features. Its reception sensitivity is
        superior in his price category (I paid 199 Euros) when
        hooked up to an external antenna. Now, on some Internet
        forums you'll find people saying the 909X is great, and
        others saying it is deaf on shortwave?! Well, my </font><a
        href="../swl-log-printout.pdf"><font size="2">SWL logs</font></a><font
        size="2"> and </font><a href="swl.htm#video"><font size="2">videos</font></a><font
        size="2"> show that the 909X is far from deaf, but again,
        don't believe you will receive remote weak ham stations
        with your whip antenna, whatever brand of radio you buy.
        Apart from being a great shortwave radio, the 909X
        provides superb FM reception and sound quality (with
        RDS/RDBS/PS/PTY/CT), LW and MW bands and plenty external
        connections (antenna, aux in, rec line out with remote,
        headphone) and an external power supply with good EMI
        suppression. The batteries are automatically charged
        inside the radio. If you have questions about the 909X
        you can contact me through my </font><a

        <h4><font size="2">The Antenna</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">Most good portable shortwave receivers
        come with an external antenna. Such antennas are usually
        a reel with a wire of some 6 meters (20 feet), connected
        with a 3.5 mm jack to the receiver. This short external
        antenna will already improve reception considerably and
        will enable you to capture many broadcast stations and
        ham stations. However, don't expect miracles with a whip
        or a short external antenna inside buildings.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If you really want to improve reception
        on the HF bands, you can easily make you own so-called
        end-fed longwire (random-wire) antenna. Take a 21,5
        meters (70 feet) long thin (0.5 or 1.0 mm) enameled
        copper wire or any isolated flexible electrical wire and
        solder it to the tip connection of a 3.5 mm jack. If your
        receiver has no such external antenna jack (it really
        should) or you don't have the proper jack, you can
        connect the wire to the whip antenna with, for instance,
        an alligator clip. The difference will be remarkable!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Unfortunately, such antennas, directly
        connected to the receiver, will also increase the
        reception of noise, especially when used indoors.
        Buildings are infested with interference signals from TV,
        computer, light dimmers and many other electrical devices
        and the electrical wiring acts as a perfect antenna to
        spread that interference (and the neighbor's
        interference, thank you) all across your and other
        buildings. Simply use the whip antenna on your receiver,
        walk around the house and hold the antenna near working
        electronic devices. You will understand what we're
        talking about.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Now, you might think to solve the
        problem of interference and noise by using a coax cable
        from the radio to the wire antenna (with the coax
        shielding connected to the radio ground). However, the
        low impedance coax, usually 50 or 75 Ohm will seriously
        attenuate the signal, resulting in weak and poor
        reception. This happens because the low impedance coax
        acts as a short-circuit to the very high impedance of the
        end-fed wire antenna. If you use only a simple wire
        antenna, do not connect it to a coax unless you also use
        a transformer or so-called balun to match the antenna to
        the coax (see below under 'Transformer')!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Nevertheless, a simple 21 meters long
        wire will already make a huge difference. If you don't
        have the free space to place a large fixed antenna, this
        is the best option for you. Please note that such simple
        antenna wires, permanently fixed in open air, can suffer
        from a buildup of static. Connecting a static charged
        wire could damage the receiver. It's good practice to
        connect the jack of such wire antennas a short moment to
        a grounding or a large metal object to bleed any static
        before connecting it to your receiver. Prudence is a good
        habit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">At the bottom of this page you'll find
        a video of my 909X receiving 40 meter band ham stations
        with such an antenna, only 2 meters (6 feet) above the
        ground! Not bad at all, but if you happen to have a nice
        garden, keep on reading and make yourself happy with a
        good antenna.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Good reception is only possible when
        you have both a good radio and a good antenna system.
        Even the best receiver is useless without a good antenna
        system. We should point out the essential difference
        between &quot;antenna&quot; and &quot;antenna
        system&quot;: an antenna captures radio waves and an
        antenna system is the comprehensive installation that
        brings the radio waves in good condition to your radio.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Now, there's often some
        misunderstanding about antennas. If you have an antenna
        that has the correct length, you can never make it
        receive more or better. What you can do is to place it in
        the ideal position to capture signals, and you can reduce
        the noise level so that the signal is more readable. The
        signal-to-noise ratio is what makes the signal readable.
        Even very weak signals are more readable than strong
        signals if they carry less noise: you simply turn up the
        volume. If you experience too much noise, turning up the
        volume will turn up the noise equally, even on strong
        signals. The good news is that anyone with basic
        soldering experience can homebuilt a good antenna system
        that provides excellent reception for less than 100 Euros
        or $120. You don't need to be familiar with electronics
        or radio technology.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>! The antenna
        system, described on this page, is only suitable for <u>receiving</u>
        purposes and should <u>never be used to transmit</u>. The
        toroids are not suitable to dissipate the power and the
        impedance of the system is not adapted to the transceiver
        output.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Below the circuit diagram of a commonly
        used long-wire antenna system: the wire antenna is
        connected to a 9:1 transformer, also called UNUN
        (Unbalanced to Unbalanced) that is grounded to a 2,5
        meter (8 feet) long copper tube, driven in the ground.
        The 9:1 transformer brings down the very high impedance
        of the end-fed wire antenna to an impedance that is
        suitable for both coax and receiver. The feedline
        transports the signal to a wall connection box. From
        there, a coax brings the signal to the external antenna
        jack. The transformer ground, and optionally receiver
        ground, are connected to the grounding rod with the
        shortest possible wires, all near the entry of the coax
        into the house.<br>
        </font><img src="../pics/antennasystem1.jpg" width="916"
        height="454"></p>
        <p><font size="2">Inside the house, the coax that comes
        from the transformer is connected to the connection box
        with a BNC chassis connector which in turn is connected
        to a second BNC chassis connector at the front of the
        box. The easiest way to connect the external antenna jack
        to the inside coax cable is to use a small box with on
        one side a BNC chassis connector that is soldered to the
        wires that go to the antenna jack. Make sure that the
        coax ground (shielding) is connected to the sleeve of the
        jack and the core wire of the coax is connected to the
        tip of the jack.</font></p>

        caused by an incorrectly connected antenna.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Never accidentally insert the external
        antenna jack into some other (audio) jack. They look the
        same and are mechanically the same, but I don't know what
        it could do to your radio, since the transformer output
        virtually short-circuits LF and DC signals. I
        accidentally inserted the antenna jack into the headphone
        socket of my 909X a few times (stupid me) without any
        damage. Nevertheless, be careful not to do so. You might
        attach a flashy warning label to the cable, next to the
        jack, as our brain is conditioned to put such jacks
        always into an audio socket.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If your receiver has a separate
        grounding connection (often with butterfly nut), you can
        connect that ground to the ground connection of the wall
        connection box. It is strongly advised to use one single
        grounding point and to connect each of the separate parts
        of the antenna system, each with its own heavy gauge or
        flat cable grounding wire, to that single grounding
        point, and to keep these wires as short as possible.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">The RF Grounding</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">First, we need to construct our RF
        (radio frequency) grounding. Without this grounding, the
        current can't flow through the primary winding of the
        transformer. Once the grounding is finished and we have
        made the transformer, we can do the first tests of our
        system.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The grounding is a 2,5 meter (8 feet)
        long copper water tube, at least 20 mm (0.8 inch) in
        diameter, found in your local DIY store (use blank copper
        tubes!). If you have the materials and the money, you may
        use a longer tube with a larger diameter. Select a
        location where rain can easily penetrate the ground. Try
        avoiding areas with concrete or large plants or trees, as
        those absorb a major part of the water and you'll be left
        with dry soil that doesn't conduct enough for our antenna
        system. You could make the surface descending a bit
        towards the grounding to guide rainwater towards it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The tube is driven 2,5 meter deep in
        the soil. Don't try hitting the tube in the ground with a
        hammer (and bending it eventually). There's a far easier
        way to do this with the help of hydro-power! Simply take
        a piece of plastic tube with one end attached (witch a
        standard connector) to your garden hose, and the other
        end pushed over the copper tube and tightened with a
        clamping ring. Open the water tap and push the water
        spraying end of the copper tube in the ground. With the
        help of the water, the tube will go downwards with very
        little force. Oh, and wear boots or slippers, it gets
        pretty wet around you!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I managed to drive my copper tubes the
        full 2,5 meters into the ground within a mere 2 minutes!
        I encountered a clay layer but with some poking, it got
        through without any problem. You'll be amazed how fast
        this goes! Use grounding wire (flat woven copper car
        battery cable) or several twisted thick copper wires to
        connect the copper tubes to the antenna system. Connect
        the ground wire with a special electrical grounding clamp
        to the copper tube or twist it several turns around the
        tube and solder it with a big soldering iron or gas
        burner firmly to the tube. Seal off the connection with
        adhesive and/or heat-shrink to make the connection
        weather resistant.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE</strong>:
        NEVER use the AC ground, found on the 220V outlets at
        home as RF grounding. Apart from being stupidly
        dangerous, the electric installation's grounding is the
        worst ever RF grounding. If you don't have a garden or
        suitable soil to drive the copper tubes into, you might
        consider burying copper wire radials horizontally in the
        top soil or laying them on the surface. These copper
        wires should run underneath the antenna wire and act as a
        virtual earth. Check the Internet for more info on RF
        radials.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">The Transformer</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The primary function of the 9:1
        transformer (this type is also called Unun or unbalanced
        to unbalanced) is to bring down the very high impedance,
        typical for end-fed longwire antennas, to a lower
        impedance that is suitable for most receivers. An
        interesting property of this type of transformer is that
        the primary winding is directly connected to the ground,
        preventing the buildup of static on the antenna.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">You could buy these Unun transformer
        but these quickly cost more than 30 Euros or $35 and most
        of them - sadly - don't have a separate ground
        connection. For receiving purposes only, you can make
        them yourself for less than 5 euro. The most expensive
        part will probably be its housing. I used a professional
        box, but you can just as well use a pillbox or a short
        piece of PVC water tube with two stops. Just make sure
        that the container is waterproof. There are plenty of DIY
        Unun construction ideas on the Internet.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Making you own transformer sounds
        scarier than it actually is. First, you need to find a
        suitable toroid ferrite core. For receiving purposes
        only, the core material, size and windings are far less
        critical. You can find such toroid cores (suitable to
        make HF transformers) in good electronic shops or on the
        Internet. If you really, really, can't get hold of a
        toroid ferrite core, you could recover the ferrite rod
        from an old portable radio. This will also work pretty
        well as transformer, but you'll have to experiment a bit
        with the windings. However, toroids are better
        transformers and they are immune to external
        electromagnetic interference because of their circular
        shape.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Here in Europe, Conrad sells the 26 mm
        toroid core part # </font><a
        href="http://www.conrad-uk.com/ce/en/product/500671/Epcos-Coated-toroid-core-B64290-L618-X830-R2510"

        size="2"> for a few Euros. In contrast to the image on
        their website, they are well coated (in blue) and of good
        quality. I used exactly these and, as you can see in my
        SWL log below, they do an excellent job! You can use 0.5
        or 1.0 mm enameled copper wire (the latter stays better
        in place but it gets a bit tight inside the core). Never
        use blank copper wire because without isolation you'll
        shortcircuit the windings! Before starting to wind,
        measure the circumference of one turn around the core and
        multiply that by 24. Add some 20 cm (8 inch) extra to
        connect the transformer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/transformer.jpg"
        width="669" height="158"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We need 24 turns for the primary
        (large) winding, divided over three times 8 windings.
        Start winding the wire tight around the core and divide
        the 8 turns over the whole circumference of the core (see
        A). Bend the wire well around the corners to keep the
        wire against the core. Pass the starting point of the
        wire and continue to wind with the long piece of wire a
        second series of 8 turns, just next to the previous turns
        and finally wind a third series of 8 turns, again next to
        the previous windings (the result should look like B).
        The secondary (small) winding has only 8 turns. You start
        at the opposite side of the core and wind the 8 turns
        nicely next to the existing windings around the
        circumference of the whole core (see C) until you arrive
        back at the opposite side.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Note that some people wind such
        quadfilar toroids with four separate wires at once and
        then solder the separate parts of the wirings together.
        For such small toroids, I find it easier and faster to
        use a single wire for each winding. A good advice: start
        with a wire that is long enough!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Finished? Congratulations, you just
        made a quadfilar 9:1 transformer! Not that hard. Make
        sure to mark the primary and secondary windings so that
        you don't mix up the connections! Now that your first
        donut received its stripes, and before you put it in its
        housing, you might already want to do some quick testing.
        Solder one wire of the primary (larger) winding, one of
        the secondary (smaller) winding, and two test wires all
        together (scrape off the enamel before soldering). One of
        the test wires goes to the ground and one is soldered to
        the sleeve of a 3,5 mm stereo jack. The free wire of the
        primary winding goes to the antenna and the free wire of
        the secondary winding is soldered to the tip of a 3,5 mm
        stereo jack.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">String up the long wire, put the jack
        into the receiver's external antenna socket and start
        testing all HF bands. Normally, 24 and 8 turns on the
        toroid should tune the whole band pretty well. If really
        necessary, adjust the number of turns (in that case,
        you'll need to rewind the toroid completely) with a few
        more windings to emphasize lower frequencies or a few
        less windings for higher frequencies. Do keep the same 3
        to 1 radio (this provides the 9:1 transformation).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Finally, if you're happy with the
        result, unsolder the wires and put the toroid core in a
        watertight box. Solder the toroid wires to the connectors
        (solder grease makes the job easier): solder one side of
        the primary winding, one side of the secondary winding
        and the ground (chassis) of a BNC connector all together
        to the grounding bolt. The remaining wire of the primary
        winding goes to the antenna bolt, and the remaining wire
        of the secondary winding is soldered to the bus
        connection of the BNC connector.</font></p>

            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><font size="2">The antenna is
                21,5 meters (70.5 feet) of thin copper wire (a
                steel wire can also be used but copper has better
                electrical properties). This can be normal
                electrical copper wire (1 or 2 mm) or copperweld
                antenna wire (which is stronger than normal
                copper wire and doesn't stretch as much). You can
                use insulated wire, which also protects the wire
                against the sun and pollution. Its length is
                ideal for the 20 meters ham DX band (14.2 MHz)
                and a compromise that enables good reception on
                the lower and higher shortwave frequencies. If
                you use black insulated wire, you will have a
                very stealthy antenna. Such wires are virtually
                invisible. Antenna masts or trees that blend in
                the landscape are a plus (my wife loves gardens
                and dislikes antennas, but she never
                complained...so far).</font><p><font size="2">The
                antenna is attached to two insulators which are
                attached to nylon tension cords (3 to 4 mm). On
                one side of the antenna, the cord runs through a
                pulley downwards where a weight keeps the antenna
                wire straight (dangling copper wires eventually
                break). Select a weight that only prevents the
                wire from moving too much but doesn't stretches
                the wire until breaking point. On the other side,
                the cord is attached directly to the mast and the
                insulated antenna wire travels vertically down
                the mast to the 9:1 transformer.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Never place the transformer at
                the top of the mast (like many do with a 9:1
                balun for end-fed antennas), since you need a
                good - short - grounding. If you'd place it on
                top of the mast, the long grounding wire will
                capture additional interference since it acts as
                a second pole for the antenna. Also, don't try
                replacing the vertical part of the wire with a
                coax of which the shielding is grounded, in some
                kind of attempt to move the active part of the
                wire to the top of the mast. It &quot;looks&quot;
                like a good idea but unfortunately, the low
                impedance coax will act like a short-circuit to
                the very high impedance of the wire antenna and
                seriously attenuate the signal.</font></p>

        to ground level - makes it more omnidirectial). You can
        use one or two masts or a big tree (big because those
        swing less in the wind) but never tie the wire directly
        between two fixed points without any system to relief
        tension (pulleys, spring...). When mast or tree are moved

        photo above, by sawing (or with a drill with circular
        cutting blade) two rounds, about 30 mm diameter, and two
        rounded rectangles. Next, you drill holes into the little
        rounds and the rectangles, place the rounds between the
        rectangles and fix them together with two bolts. I also
        drilled two little holes at the side of the insulator to
        attach straps that support the wire that goes down.</font></p>

        antenna system for shortwave listening, where the antenna
        is placed much further away from the house. The wire
        antenna is connected to a 9:1 transformer that is
        grounded to a 2,5 meter (8 feet) long copper tube, driven
        into the ground. The feedline, grounded both near the
        transformer and near the house, transports the signal to
        the receiver, where a second 1:1 transformer separates
        the feedline from the receiver.</font></p>

        windings of 8 turns. Take the tiny 11 mm core and wind 8
        turns of 0.5 mm copper over the whole circumference of
        the toroid core. Next, wind another 8 turns over the

        <p><font size="2">I used a small piece of 5/8 PVC
        electrical tube with two stops at the ends to put the
        small toroid in. It's small, slim and light. One side (it
        doesn't matter which) is connected to a chassis BNC
        connector. On the other side you should make some kind of
        strain relief (e.g. with straps inside) to avoid that the
        cable pulls on the soldering connections towards the
        radio.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The second transformer is connected to
        the receiver's external antenna input with a 3,5 mm
        stereo jack. Make sure that one side, coming from the
        transformer (it doesn't matter which), is connected to
        the tip of the jack, and the other side to the sleeve of
        the jack. You may use audio cable for that last piece to
        the jack since the balanced line catches virtually no
        interference. The cable between transformer and receiver
        should be less than 1 meter (3feet). If available, use a
        90° angled audio jack because it puts less strain on
        your receiver's antenna socket. An audio jack with the
        cable already attached to it (from an old headphone or
        such) will do just fine and is more rigid than a soldered
        jack.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>WARNING</strong>: again, this
        is how the external antenna connection works on my <strong>Sangean
        ATS 909X</strong> and on some other brands. However,
        other radios might have another antenna socket wiring
        setup! Inform yourself about how to connect the external
        antenna on your radio! I'm not liable for any damage,
        caused by an incorrectly connected antenna.</font></p>

                connects the outside transformer to a connection
                box inside the house. You can use any 50 or 75
                Ohm coax cable. For receiving purposes, you don't
                need professional radio coax. TV/Sat coax cable
                of good quality with double alu-foil shielding is
                perfect (better shielding) and much cheaper.</font><p><font
                size="2">However, it is impossible to solder the
                shielding of this type of coax. In that case, you
                should use F-bus/BNC adaptors to connect such a
                coax to the BNC connectors (available in good
                electronics stores). My outside TV/Sat coax is
                some 30 meters (100 feet). I first tested it with
                a full 50 meters (165 feet) roll and there's
                virtually no loss of signal.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Put the coax in a flexible
                electrical tube and bury it a few feet deep in
                the ground. Try to use one single piece of tube
                or glue and/or tape the tube connections
                (sleeves) carefully to prevent water from getting
                into the tube. Another - far more expensive -
                option is to buy the heavy black TV/Sat coax that
                is suitable for burying.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">On the outside of the house,
                the buried coax and second grounding arrive in a
                waterproof box (keep some turns of coax to have a
                margin inside). A connection box on the inside
                wall contains two female BNC connectors.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The outside coax (if you used
                TV/Sat coax, it would carry an F-bus/BNC adaptor)
                is connected to that box. Remember to drill the
                hole in the wall from inside to outside and
                angled downwards to avoid problems with incoming
                water.</font></p>

                has a stiffer solid core that could break if you
                bent it too much, or use flexible radio coax.
                It's up to you to decide, depending on whether
                you move around at different locations in your
                house or use a fixed installation. If you use
                flexible radio coax, use two male BNC connectors
                to connect the connection box to the small
                transformer near the receiver.</font><p><font
                size="2">Of course, you may devise your own
                system of connectors that is more suitable to
                your receiver or local situation. You could use
                SO239/PL connectors, commonly used for radio
                equipment. Some of the chassis BNC connectors can
                be replaced by F-bus chassis types, to make the
                F-bus/BNC adapator redundant. However, I sticked
                to BNC to keep the connections compatible.
                Personally, for low power and receiving purposes,
                I find BNC connectors more practical to easily
                connect and disconnect.</font></p>

        <h4><font size="2">When, Where and How to Listen</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">If all the nuts and bolts are wired and
        connected correctly, you will now have your first actual
        &quot;antenna system&quot;. You will be amazed by the
        difference! Just put up your standard external antenna,
        provided with your shortwave receiver. While tuned to
        some weak station, switch between the jacks of the
        standard external antenna and your newly homebuilt
        antenna system. If you have put it all together
        correctly, you'll have a big smile on your face by now.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Now that you have a good receiver and
        antenna system, you can start listening to stations.
        However, finding stations might not be that obvious. You
        can't simply turn the dial and hope to receive something.
        The shortwave frequency range (1,8 - 30 MHz) is divided
        into several bands, from 160 meter to 10 meter, and
        specific frequency ranges are allocated to specific
        broadcast, utility or amateur stations. These SW bands
        are commonly denoted by their wavelength, given in
        meters.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The length of a radio wave is
        calculated by the formula Wavelength = 300 / F
        (Wavelength in meters and Frequency in MHz). For
        instance, 30 Mhz = 10 m, 7.5 Mhz = 40 m and 1,8 Mhz =
        160m band. For practical reasons, these bands are divided
        into larger frequency ranges. Thus, the popular 14 MHz
        ham DX band is commonly called the 20 meter band by ham
        amateurs, although its wavelength is 300/14 or 21,4
        meter. Note that below 10 MHZ, ham and utility stations
        commonly use LSB and from 10 MHz upwards they use USB. If
        you select or tune the SSB incorrectly, you end up with
        either a Barry White or Donald Duck voice, really! Of
        course, for broadcast stations, AM is the default mode.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">How far you can communicate or listen
        and how readable a signal is on a specific shortwave band
        can vary extremely, from excellent at 20.000 Km to
        completely no communications (a so-called closed band) at
        500 Km, depending on the space weather (solar activity,
        sun spots, solar flares), time of the day (day, night,
        sunrise or sunset, the grey zone), season (winter or
        summer) and atmospheric conditions (weather, moisture,
        skip distances). We can estimate band conditions but can
        never give exact predictions. A particular band that
        works today can be closed tomorrow or vice versa. Of
        course, if a band is &quot;closed&quot;, HAM amateurs
        switch to other bands with better conditions. For
        successful shortwave listening, it's important that you
        know the condition of the bands and understand which
        bands to listen to. The great thing about shortwave is
        that you can receive the most exotic stations under
        favorable conditions. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">My main interest goes to the amateur
        radio ham bands and the following information refers to
        the reception of these stations. Of course, receiving
        public broadcast stations is a bit easier, as their air
        schedules and frequencies are publicly available (on the
        Internet) beforehand. To me, searching for ham stations
        can be compared to fishing at open sea, whereas receiving
        broadcast stations is a bit like fishing in a fishpond,
        you know where they are, you just have to catch them.
        With the antenna system I use, almost each step on the
        909X tuning dial catches another shortwave broadcast
        station loud and clear. Talking about sensitive!
        Nevertheless, catching weak remote broadcast stations can
        also be very challenging! Sometimes, you need to turn up
        the receiver's gain control to catch a weak station and
        on other occasions there are so many stations or
        interference that you need to turn back the gain control
        to make a station readable.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The 20 meter (14,2 MHz) and the
        lesser-used 17 meter (18,1 MHz) bands are the most
        popular for DX-ing (large-distance receiving) around the
        globe and, Unfortunately for the beauty-sleepers among
        us, work best after sunset. Nevertheless, when
        propagation is very good, you can receive quite some DX
        stations during the day. The 40 meter band (7,2 MHz)
        usually doesn't reach that far, but works pretty fine
        during the day up to a few thousand kilometers. In ideal
        propagation conditions, it will enable some DX-ing. The
        80 meter band (3,5 MHz) is a local band and reaches only
        some hundreds of a thousand kilometers far, although its
        range also increases in the evening or in favorable
        propagation conditions. Sunset is the period that
        everything can become a bit - actually very - chaotic and
        very noisy, but once the sun is well asleep, things get
        great on the HF bands. Of course, it all depends on the
        type of antenna (wire, dipole, directional) and the power
        output of the transmitting station.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">With some experience you will also
        learn at what frequency and time of the day and year you
        should search for a station on a particular location. You
        will learn not to search in vain on the 80 meter band for
        a Caribbean station when you're located in Europe, nor
        will you try to catch an Australian ham station in the
        evening, here in Europe, although propagation is very
        good (the Aussi will be in a deep sleep in the middle of
        his night). Time difference is an important factor in
        estimating how active stations are in a particular
        country.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Amateur radio organizations often
        organize local or DX contests, usually in the weekends.
        Weekends are the moment to catch many ham stations. A
        good trick is to find a contest station that calls out
        &quot;CQ DX&quot;, the request for long distance
        communications. When that ham is lucky, you might also be
        lucky and catch many of the stations that answer his call
        for DX communications. That's what we call DX hunting!
        Sometimes you can catch special event stations,
        temporarily in the air to celebrate some special
        occasion. Those are the cream on your SWL cake.
        Information on contests and special events can be found
        on the internet.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It is a good habit to keep a log of all
        the stations you received, including the time in UTC
        (global time standard for radio stations) and date,
        location and signal quality. You could create your own
        log (for example in Excel) or download ham or SWL log
        software from the Internet. Whatever you decide, log
        those station, as you will learn a lot from it and it's
        fun to keep track of all the captured countries and
        distances. Ham operators use official worldwide
        registered call signs. You can look up these call signs
        on the Internet to see where the ham station is located
        and how far away it is. These call signs are spelled out
        phonetically. A list of the different phonetic alphabets
        is found below in the document I compose.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Among radio amateurs, signal reporting
        is standardized by the RST code. R stands for Readability
        (1 to 5), S stands for Signal (1 to 9) and T stands for
        Tone (1 to 9). The T is usually omitted for speech
        communications. Thus, if you hear the operator say
        &quot;you're 5 over 7&quot; or &quot;you're 57&quot;, he
        means that the sender is perfectly understandable and the
        signal is pretty good. If the signal is very strong, more
        than 9 on their signal meter, they'll say &quot;59 plus
        10&quot; or &quot;10 dB over 9&quot;. There's also a more
        detailed but lesser-used SINPO signal report code. It's
        also useful to get familiar with the commonly used
        so-called Q-codes, used by ham operators. Information
        about the RST and SINPO reports and a list of common
        Q-codes is also found in the document I composed (see
        below)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Of course, there are also some utility
        stations in-between the common communications band and
        there are messages in CW (Morse) and all kinds of digital
        signals. On the internet you find lots of - free -
        software to convert those special signals into readable
        text on your computer (hook up your receiver output to
        the PC audio input through an audio isolation
        transformer, to avoid the big interference computers
        cause).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">I hope you will enjoy SWL
        as much as I do. The world of shortwave signals is an
        exciting and challenging world. It's up to you to decide
        how challenging you make it by using your own homebuilt
        antennas to improve reception. You can find plenty of
        information on the Internet about antenna systems, how to
        construct sensitive directive antennas and how to wind
        your own transformers and baluns to correctly feed the
        antenna to your receiver. The possibilities are endless.
        Good luck with the hunt!</font></p>
