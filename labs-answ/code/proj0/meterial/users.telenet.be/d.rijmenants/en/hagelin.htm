        This is the story of Boris Hagelin, a brilliant engineer,
        and his famous cipher machines. He is the only inventor
        and developer of crypto machines in history to have made
        a fortune in that market. Hagelin and Crypto AG are still
        most respected names in the world of crypto machines and
        have dominated the commercial market of cryptology for

                born on July 2nd, 1892 in Adschikent, Russia. His
                Swedish father sent him to Sweden, where he
                graduated in 1914 as mechanical engineer. His
                future was already planned in the Nobel company's
                Oilfields, where his father was the manager.
                Initially, he specialized in electrical
                engineering in order to become supervisor of the
                construction of an electric power plant for the
                Nobel Company in Baku. After the revolution in
                1920 the Nobel family entered into a partnership
                with the Standard Oil Company in the US, and
                Boris moved to the US to work in their General
                engineering Department. After one year he
                returned to Sweden. </font><p><font size="2">Emanuel
                Nobel asked Boris Hagelin to supervise a small
                Swedish company, A.B. Cryptograph, which
                manufactured ciphermachines, invented by the
                Swedish engineer Arvid Damm. In 1925 he took over
                management and started developing new machines.
                In 1932 A.B Cryptoteknik replaced the liquidated
                A.B. Cryptograph. After the Second World War
                Hagelin moved to Zug, in neutral Switzerland and
                established Crypto AG. This relocation was
                required since Sweden considered Cryptographic
                equipment as weapons, and thus prohibited their
                export. The pre-war reputation of mechanical
                &quot;Hagelin Cryptos&quot; devices and the need
                for enciphered telegraph equipment helped the
                firm to grow and laid the foundation for a new
                generation of electronic cipher equipment. Boris
                Hagelin died in 1983 at the age of 91.</font></p>

                <font size="2">Hagelin B-21 and the First Success</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">In 1925 the Swedish General
                Staff contacted A.B. Cryptograph to design a
                machine that would be superior to the German
                Enigma. Hagelin developed a prototype for
                evaluation called B-21. The B-21 was approved for
                the Swedish General Staff and Hagelin also sold
                the machine to several other countries. Its
                principle was based on Arvid Damm's simplified
                rotors, a 5 x 5 grid design. The machine had a
                keyboard, 2 rotors of which the stepping was
                controlled by two pairs of pin-wheels and a
                display with 25 lamps that presented the output
                of the en/de-cipherment. The machine was operated
                on 110 or 220 volt and the lamp panel was powered
                by a battery. Depressing a key would close two
                contacts, each contact in one of two groups of
                five contacts. The signal then passed through two
                rotors to the 25 lamps. Interchangeable leads, in
                series with the rotors, could be connected as
                desired. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">This machine was the first to
                apply pin-wheels, a feature that was used in many
                of its successors. A pin-wheel is a disk with a
                number of axial holes in which pins are located.
                These pins can be moved either to the left or to
                the right side of the disk. On one side, these
                pins are inactive, on the other side active. With
                each step, the pin-wheel moves one pin position.
                Several different pin-wheels with different
                numbers of pins without a common factor are used
                to obtain a very long key period. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In 1932 the French Army was
                interested in the B-21 but asked for two
                important modifications. The machine had to be
                portable and should be able to print the text.
                Hagelin developed the B-211 which could be
                operated either with electric power or by hand
                with a crank. He replaced the lamp panel with a
                type-wheel printing mechanism and the ciphering
                circuits were powered by a battery. About 500
                B-211 machines were built. In 1940 Hagelin
                installed a workshop in Sweden with the profits
                of the successful B-211 and A.B. Cryptograph was
                renamed in A.B. Ingenieursfirman Cryptoteknik.</font></p>

                <font size="2">The C Type Machines</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">Already in 1934 the French
                Cipher Bureau asked Hagelin to develop a compact
                cipher machine that could also print. Hagelin got
                the idea to adapt a calculating mechanism from a
                money changer into a small crypto device. The
                infamous pin-and-lug machines were born.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The first machine, the C-35,
                consisted of a drum with 25 bars, five pin-wheels
                (identical to the ones used in the B-21) and an
                alphabet-knob/type-wheel with reciprocal alphabet
                (type-wheel alphabet reversed to knob alphabet).
                By using a reciprocal encryption it was very easy
                to switch between enciphering and deciphering.
                The text was printed on a small paper ribbon. The
                compact device had the size of a small lunch box.
                Military personnel could put it in a side pocket
                of the uniform.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">To encipher a letter the
                operator turned the alphabet knob to the desired
                letter and turned the handle at the right side of
                the machine. The type-wheel, fixed to the
                alphabet knob, then turned a number of steps,
                depending on the settings of the machine. The
                enciphered letter was printed on the paper ribbon
                or the operator could read off the reciprocal
                alphabet on the knob. The wheel-pins were set
                each day according to a key sheet. Before each
                enciphering of a new message, the operator would
                set a new start position of the 5 pin-wheels on
                the exterior.</font></p>

            <tr>
                <td valign="top" colspan="2"><font size="2">The
                movable slide-bars on the drum contain fixed
                lugs. When the drum is revolved with the handle
                outside the machine, the different lugs pass 5
                cams that are under control of the pins on the
                five pin-wheels. If a pin is active, the cam of
                that wheel will push a passing lug to the left.
                The slide-bar on which that lug is fixed will
                also move to the left and comes out of the drum
                as a small teeth. The left side of the drum will
                therefore act as a gear wheel with a variable
                number of teeth, engaging the type wheel. The
                number of tooth, and thus the displacement of the
                type wheel, depends on the settings of the lugs
                and pins.</font><p><font size="2">The 5 wheels
                had 17, 19, 21, 23 and 25 pins. Since these
                numbers have no common factor the same wheel
                setting would only occur once every 3,900,225
                steps. On top of this, there were theoretically
                10E29 different possibilities to set the many
                pins on the wheels. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">An improved version with
                protective casing and another lug arrangement,
                and later on with movable lugs on the drum, was
                designated C-36 and. Its successor, the C-38, had
                six pinwheels. The lugs on this machine could
                slide on the drum bars in one of 5 active or an
                inactive position. This improvement, together
                with the larger wheel period, provided a very
                large key space. Another version, designated
                BC-543, was fitted with a keyboard. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In 1940 Hagelin went to the USA
                to promote his C Type machines which resulted in
                the largest sale ever of crypto machines. The US
                military selected his C-38 as tactical ciphering
                device and designated it as M-209. By the end of
                the Second World War over 140,000 of these small
                M-209 machines were produced in the US. A
                simulator of the M-209 can be downloaded </font><a

                <font size="2">The C-52 and CX-52</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">Although the C-36 and C-38 were
                ideal for tactical purposes they were
                insufficient for the enciphering of high level
                message traffic that could resist extensive
                cryptanalysis. An improved version would open the
                door to the market of high level military and
                diplomatic encryption. Hagelin went back to the
                drawing table to improve his C Machines. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Several improvements were
                introduced in the C-52 model. The rotation of the
                pin-wheels became irregular. Whether a wheel
                moved or not on a given cycle depended on the pin
                positions of the previous wheels. For the 6 wheel
                model there was now the choice between 12
                pin-wheels, with 25, 26, 29, 31, 34, 37, 38, 41,
                42, 43, 46 and 47 pins. The number of slide-bars
                was increased to 32. A second type wheel was
                added to print both plain and ciphered text at
                the same time on a split paper ribbon and it was
                possible to set a relative position between the
                primary and secondary type wheel. Also, a type
                wheel with letters that could be rearranged
                became available. The later CX-52 model has 6
                pinwheels with 47 pins each and a more flexible
                pinwheel advancing system as the C-52, resulting
                in a complex and higly irregular wheel movement. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Instead of developing a version
                with fixed keyboard like the BC-543 machine, the
                C-52 could be fitted with a separate keyboard
                attachment, called B-52 which included the

                Gendarmerie, a small pocket device was developed
                with the name CD-55. Two years later, the CD-57
                was manufactured. Input and output consisted of a
                ring with an alphabet and a rotatable disk
                inside. The alphabet was displaced by pressing a
                levergrip with the thumb. The displacement
                depended on the setup of 6 small pin-wheels,
                similar to those used in the C Type machines.
                About 12,000 of these pocket models were sold to
                different countries. The CD-57 RT is has an
                option to use one-time tapes (random five bit
                punched tapes).</font></p>

        and had 6 fixed pin-wheels and a drum with 2 x 12
        slide-bars, similar to the C-36 model. The T-52 was
        produced in series between 1953 and 1954. Its successor,
        the T-55 used 6 interchangeable pin-wheels and a drum
        with 22 slide-bars, similar to the C-52 series. The T-55
        had a tape reader that could be used to perform a
        superencipherment. This was a combination of the normal
        enciphering with a random one-time-tape. The T-55 was in
        production until 1956. </font></p>

                types of mechanical encryptions and developed
                several different prototypes. One special version
                of the C Machine was the C-36 with Autokey, which
                had a second drum, connected via gears to the
                indicating disk. The device never came into
                production because of the problems, inherent to
                the Autokey system, to recover the message when
                an error during transmission occurred. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The TMX-53 was a ciphering
                teleprinter but its development was stopped as
                Crypto AG could not compete with major
                teleprinter firms. Instead, Crypto AG focused on
                the Telecrypto Machine which could be connected
                to standard teleprinter machines. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">An advanced electromechanical
                cipher machine was developed and designated
                HX-63. The HX-63 had 9 rotors with 41 circuits of
                which the surplus wires were looped back on the
                outside (somewhat similar to the KL-7 ADONIS).
                All circuits could be rearranged and the rotors
                performed irregular movements like the C-52
                series. All this provided an incredible key space
                of 10<sup>600</sup>. Manufacture of the HX-63 was
                abandoned due to the development of fully
                electronic cipher machines.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The CBI-53 was a random number
                generator with a printer, which used 40 type
                wheels and mixing chambers which held 26 steel
                balls of which one ball was a bit larger than the
                other 25 balls. After mixing, the balls were run
                into a tube until the thick ball blocked the
                tube. The number of balls in the tube was
                measured and determined the rotation of the type
                wheel.</font></p>

                mechanical and electromechanical cipher machines
                to fully electronic machines, Crypto AG kept
                playing a leading role in the development of new
                crypto systems such as the H-4605, HC-520, and
                more recently the SECOS radio series, MULTICOM
                radio encryption, encrypted satellite lines and
