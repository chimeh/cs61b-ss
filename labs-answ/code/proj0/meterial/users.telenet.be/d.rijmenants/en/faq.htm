        On this page, I will try to answer a few FAQ's I received
        since I published my Enigma pages. I hope you find some
        answers or solutions to your problems here. If not, you
        can always <a
        href="invulform.htm">send
        me a mail</a>.</h5>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        I have an Enigma message, but don't know the key settings
        to this message. Can you help me?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Unfortunately, no! You need the
        key settings for rotors, their order and ring settings,
        the start position of the rotors, the reflector and
        plugs. There are 107,458,687,327,250,619,360,000 possible
        keys! More about this number </font><a
        href="enigmatech.htm#maths"><font size="2">at this page</font></a><font
        size="2">. An Enigma M4 is even harder to break. Breaking
        one single small message is almost a mission impossible.
        However, if you have vast computer power resources, the
        proper cryptanalytic techniques, and some luck, you could
        succeed. An example is Stefan Krah's </font><a
        href="m4project.htm"><font size="2">M4 Project</font></a><font
        size="2">. Some mathematics about it can be found on the </font><a

        target="_blank"><font size="2">NSA website</font></a><font
        size="2">. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        Can I buy a real Enigma machine?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Yes! Many surviving Enigmas are
        now hot collector items. You could contact people like
        David Hamer, Tom Perera or John Alexander to buy one (see
        my</font><a href="links.htm"><font size="2"> links page</font></a><font
        size="2">), or subscribe (that's free) to the </font><a
        href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/cryptocollectors/"
        target="_blank"><font size="2">CryptoCollectors Yahoo
        group</font></a><font size="2">, a forum for people who
        collect crypto machines. Prices range between 20 and
        40,000 dollars, or more, depending on the model and
        condition. No, you can't buy one from me. You could buy a
        DIY </font><a href="http://www.cryptomuseum.com/kits/"
        target="_blank"><font size="2">Electronic Enigma-E</font></a><font
        size="2"> , sold by the Crypto Museum for about 150 Euro.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        I have problems deciphering your messages on another
        simulator, or visa versa.<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: First, check your Enigma
        settings. This simulator, unlike many others, is fully
        compatible with the real Enigma. If you haven't made an
        error while setting up the machine, or a deciphering
        error, the other sim probably works incorrectly. There's
        a lot of software on the web that doesn't work like the
        real thing. Some other correct working simulators, also
        fully compatible, can be found on Frode Weierud's or Paul
        Reuver's websites, or you can use Andy Carlson's online
        Enigma Applet. They all work just like the real thing.
        Again, double check all your rotors, their order and ring
        settings, the start position of the rotors, the reflector
        and plugs. Many Enigma novices forget one of these during
        enciphering or deciphering.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        I opened the lid on the Enigma simulator, to change some
        rotors, and I can't close it again.<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: There's no problem with the
        program! Did you click the handle in the upper left
        corner of the rotor area? If you did click it, and the
        lid still doesn't close, there are some rotors missing in
        the machine. All three (Wehrmacht) or four (Kriegsmarine)
        rotors must be in place before you can close the lid. The
        rotors, used in the Enigma, are at the top of the
        machine, not to be mistaken with the box with spare
        rotors, shown at the bottom of the machine. Once you
        inserted all required rotors, you can close the lid by
        clicking the handle.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        Does your software contain viruses, spyware or other
        nasty stuff?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: No! There are far easier ways to
        send or download nasty stuff on people's computers. I've
        spend years of research on cipher machines, and months to
        write realistic sims. The source code is </font><a
        href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/BrowseCategoryOrSearchResults.asp?lngWId=1&amp;blnAuthorSearch=TRUE&amp;lngAuthorId=2286662001&amp;strAuthorName=D.%20Rijmenants&amp;txtMaxNumberOfEntriesPerPage=25"
        target="_blank"><font size="2">freely available at PSC</font></a><font
        size="2">. So why all that effort to send you a virus? I
        just want to share my cipher passion. However, since the
        source code is freely available, you could encounter a
        bogus clone of this software elsewhere. The only official
        downloads are here, on my Dropbox page, or on the
        websites of Tom Perera and Frode Weierud (The latest
        versions only on my site)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        Where can I see a real Enigma?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: A list of museums and places
        where you can find Enigmas is available at Matt's </font><a
        href="http://tourism.wikia.com/wiki/Cryptotourism"
        target="_blank"><font size="2">Wiki Crypto Tourisme</font></a><font
        size="2"> site.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        You must be a smart guy. Do you work for NSA?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Haha, No! Old cipher machines
        are just a hobby to me, just as writing software.
        Actually, most cipher machines are not that hard to
        understand, and of rather simple construction. Anyone who
        sets his mind to it, and wastes enough time on it, can
        figure it out. Breaking cipher messages is another thing!
        If I was an NSA employee, I would not write this (and
        would probably have more money in my account ;-)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        I want to send Enigma messages to my friends, how do I
        set up my machine?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: To communicate with others, you
        need to agree on the key settings of the Enigma. You will
        have to create a key sheet and distribute it amongst your
        friends. You can use my </font><a
        href="codebook.htm"><font
        size="2">Enigma Codebook Tool</font></a><font size="2">
        to generate key sheets.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        My friend and I both have the Codebook Tool. If we enter
        the same date, the Tool generates different keys!<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Of course! Each generated
        codesheet is unique and cannot be reproduced. If anyone
        could produce the same codesheet again and again, it
        would not be secret anymore! The program isn't a
        codebook, it generates unique codebooks. Once a codebook
        is generated, one has to distribute the codebook text
        file or a printed version amongst the users. A program
        that would generate the same key over and over, would
        compromise the secrecy of the keys.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        Where can I find more authentic Enigma messages?<strong><br>
        Answer</strong>: Authentic messages are very rare! CSG,
        the Crypto Simulation Group, is occupied with breaking
        over 500 original authentic German messages that survived
        the War. Some of them are available on </font><a

        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        I have downloaded a new version of your software, and now
        have problems.<strong><br>
        Answer</strong>: Did you uninstall the previous version?
        It's better to do so. Just go to the Configuration
        screen, select Software and search for Enigma. Next, hit
        the Add/Remove button. When the old version is gone,
        install the new one.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        I think there's a problem with the middle rotor.
        Sometimes, it steps on two successive keystrokes.<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: That's normal! This is the
        famous Double Step, caused by the systems of pawls,
        ratchets an notches. The pawls are engaged on each
        keystroke, but only advance the next rotor if they can
        fall into the previous rotor notch. This happens once in
        26 steps. However, during this event, the pawl drops into
        the notch, and not only grabs the next rotor ratchet, but
        since the pawl is in the notch, it will also push the
        notch rotor one step further. Of course, this only
        appears with the middle rotor. The first, rightmost ,
        rotor always steps, and the third doesn't use its notch.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        How did you come up with the idea of writing an Enigma
        simulator?<strong><br>
        Answer</strong>: I woke up one morning and decided to
        make one. No, serious, I've been passionate about cipher
        machines and cryptology since childhood, and the Enigma
        machine is the most appealing example in history. I
        couldn't find a realistic, graphically detailed sim on
        the internet that provided authentic handling and machine
        setup, so I wrote my own.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        Why is it so hard to set up the Enigma simulator, opening
        cover, changing rotors, plugs and so on?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Because the Germans didn't have
        computers, Windows or easy program menus. They only had
        that electro-mechanical machine in a wooden box. You do
        wanted a true Enigma simulation, did you not?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        If I use the four rotor version, the fourth rotor doesn't
        step. Is there a problem?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: No! The answer is quite simple.
        The four rotor Enigma is derived from the three rotor
        version. The only changes were a thin reflector and
        fourth rotor, which took the same space as a normal wide
        reflector, and a little window to view the fourth rotor.
        That's all! They didn't adapt the rotor advance mechanism
        or add a fourth pawl. They just believed this wasn't
        important. The fourth rotor would only step once every
        17,576 keystrokes. From the cryptanalysts point of view,
        the fourth rotor increased the number of keys by 26, the
        number of possible positions, set by hand.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        What is the purpose of the Kenngruppen in Enigma
        messages?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: They were used to tell the
        receiving operator which key was used. More information
        is found on my </font><a href="enigmaproc.htm"><font
        size="2">Enigma Procedures</font></a><font size="2">
        page.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        Why does the Enigma Codebook Tool only produce 10 and not
        13 plugs or Steckerverbindungen?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: The answer is simple. The
        Germans only provided 10 cables with each machine, and a
        few spare cables attached in the case cover.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        How secure is my message, enciphered with Enigma, today?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: This depends on the situation.
        If you have only one short message, say less than 50
        letters, and you were to use that particular Enigma key
        setting only once, this would be rather secure. Don't
        forget that the number of possible keys on the Enigma
        machine is astronomical! Running through all possible
        keys would take a vast amount of time, even today.
        However, longer messages, and more messages with the same
        key would never stand against cryptanalytic attacks.
        That's how Bletchley Park did it, even without today's
        vast computer power. The CSG, Crypto Simulation Group, is
        breaking at this moment a large number of original
        authentic German messages. More info on </font><a

        target="_blank"><font size="2">Frode Weierud's website</font></a><font
        size="2">. Today, I strongly suggest never to use the
        Enigma to protect critical information!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        Did you work with an Enigma during the war?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: No! I'm not that old (thanks for
        the compliment) and never served in the German Army, I'm
        from Belgium. Neither was I employed in Bletchley Park,
        I'm not that smart (see question about NSA).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        I would like to write my own simulation. Can you help me?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Yes! The source code to my
        Enigma simulator is </font><a
        href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/BrowseCategoryOrSearchResults.asp?lngWId=1&amp;blnAuthorSearch=TRUE&amp;lngAuthorId=2286662001&amp;strAuthorName=D.%20Rijmenants&amp;txtMaxNumberOfEntriesPerPage=25"
        target="_blank"><font size="2">freely available at PSC</font></a><font
        size="2"> in a zip file download. Note that, for security
        reasons, the zip doesn't contain any exe file. It was
        written in Visual Basic. If you don't have VB, you can
        also open the <em>Module1.bas</em> file with a notepad
        and examine the code. There are many comments included,
        to explain the code. Drop me a mail when you have more
        questions or would like to use my source code. Don't
        forget to give the proper credits.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        What 's your job?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Earn money to feed wife and
        children. Period (hell of a job, if you ask me).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        I can't download and install the Enigma simulator?<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Well, it should work. Others
        don't have problems. Did you read the readme file in the
        zip? Be advised that the sim only works on Windows, and
        some people have reported to me that my simulators also
        works under Linux with WINE. You could try the
        alternative download from </font><a href="download.htm"><font
        size="2">my dropbox</font></a><font size="2"> or the
        sites from Frode Weierud or Tom Perera, but these are
        previous versions. However, for the latest version, you
        should download the sims from my website.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        Do you get rich, writing cipher machine software?<strong><br>
        Answer</strong>: Haha, No! There are several good
        freeware simulators on the net, so why bother asking
        money for it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
        You must have put lots of time and effort into this
        simulator.<br>
        <strong>Answer</strong>: Don't ask my wife about it! The
        detailed information about Enigma was collected over a
        period of several years. Don't forget that information
        about the Enigma was very scarce before people like David
        Kahn, Frode Weierud or Cryptologia published their
        work.The simulator itself took about a month to work
        properly, but had a simple user interface. Two more
        months were required to produce a graphical correct and
        detailed machine, and to write a readable helpfile. Some
        years went by before arriving at the - hopefully - final
        version v7.0. This was only possible with the kind help
        of people like Tom and Frode.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Question</strong>:
