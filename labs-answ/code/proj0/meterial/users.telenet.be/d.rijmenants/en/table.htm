        This page contains some examples of straddling
        checkerboards, a system to encode plain text into digits.
        This encoding is not a type of encryption and offers
        absolutely no cryptographic security whatsoever! The
        encoding only prepares the plaintext for the actual
        encryption process. Therefore, we call the result of
        encoding a plaincode, to stress that the message is still
        in its plain readable form.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">These checkerboards are easily designed
        from scratch or customized to fit the requirements of its
        users. This can range from simple text-only encoding to
        the use of special characters, words or codes for
        specific purposes or languages. The presented examples
        show the basic properties and possibilities of the
        checkerboard text-to-digit encoding. Anything is
        possible, as long as both sender and receiver agree upon
        a common system. The straddling checkerboard encodes the
        most frequently used letters into one-digit values. All
        other letters are encoded into two-digit values. This
        reduces the size of the message considerably (approx 1.5
        digit/letter ratio against 2.0 for fixed two-digit
        systems). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">A checkerboard also breaks up
        individual letters into seperate parts. This is called
        fractionation. Moreover, it does this irregularly (some
        are single and some double-digit values). When the
        checkerboard encoding is followed by an encryption
        algorithm that transposes the plaincode digits, then the
        irregular fractionation will cause the characters to be
        torn apart in a most irregular fashion and produce a far
        more complex encryption. Often, such encryption methods
        also use a checkerboard that has the order of its letters
        or digits scrambled to increase the total strength of the
        encryption.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Note that the fractionation properties
        and scrambled letters or digits are irrelevant when the
        checkerboard encoding is followed by one-time pad
        encryption, as this type of encryption is unbreakable
        anyway. Here, only the checkerboard's efficiency matters.
        Please visit the </font><a href="onetimepad.htm"><font
        size="2">one-time pad</font></a><font size="2"> page for
        more information about the use of checkerboards for
        one-time pad encryption.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>Some Checkerboard Variations</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">A basic checkerboard, letter-optimised
        for English and based on the &quot;AT ONE SIR&quot;
        mnemonic, a table easily composed and wirtten out on
        paper.</font></p>
        <p><img src="../pics/atonesirpaper.gif" width="442"
        height="162"></p>
        <p><font size="2">The table speaks for itself.
        &quot;F/L&quot; (68) is used to switch to figures and
        back to letters. Numbers are usually written out three
        times to exclude errors. The text &quot;A54H&quot; will
        therefore encode into &quot;0 68 555 444 68 25&quot;. The
        field &quot;/&quot; (69) is used to seperate letters or
        sentences. We can change the order of the top row letters
        to any desired combination. Some other anagram
        arragements for the &quot;AT-ONE-SIR&quot; top row
        letters are &quot;SENORITA--&quot; are
        &quot;A-NOTE-SIR&quot;, &quot;NATO-RISE-&quot;,
        &quot;RAT-NOISE-&quot;, or &quot;NO-TEA-SIR&quot;. If we
        change the position of the two blank fields in the top
        row, then we also need to replace the digit labels for
        the second and third row with the digits that correspond
        to the top row empty cells. We can also replace the top
        row letters by to the most frequently used letters of
        another language. These can vary quite a bit depending on
        the language. For more details, visit the </font><a

        target="_blank"><font size="2">letter frequency wiki page</font></a><font
        size="2">.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Let's give a short example of how the
        checkerboard works by encoding the text &quot;CONTACT
        JOHN AT 1830H&quot;. The top row letters are encoded into
        a single-digit value by taking the digit above the
        letter. The other letters are encoded in a two-digit
        value by taking the row digit, followed by the column
        digit. Once encoded into digits, we can encrypt the
        message with any digits based encryption algorithm.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">When decoding the message back from
        digits into text, we can easily distinguish single-digit
        from double-digit combinations. If the first next digit
        represents a letter in the top row, we have a
        single-digit value and simply take the letter underneath
        that digit. If however the digit is located on the
        left-hand side of a row then we have encoutered the first
        part of a double-digit value and must take the
        intersection of that digit's row and the following
        digit's column to find the letter that corresponds to
        that double-digit value.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Although the checkerboard from above is
        simple to compose and to use, you can format such a table
        in another more practical and faster format for complex
        checkerboards with a larger number of cells:</font></p>
        <p><img src="../pics/atonesir.gif" width="402"
        height="122"></p>
        <p><font size="2">The following standard checkerboard is
        also optimised for English and has some extre features.
        Note that each additional empty cell in the top row
        enables the creation of an additional row with 10 new
        characters.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/aeinot.gif"
        width="402" height="162"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This checkerboard incorporates several
        puntuation and the space &quot;SPC&quot; (99). Here,
        &quot;FIG&quot; (90) has the same function as the
        &quot;L/F&quot; field from the previous table. The
        &quot;REQ&quot; (98) field is the abbreviation of
        &quot;REQUEST&quot; as in &quot;request help&quot; or
        &quot;request new supplies&quot;. The table also contains
        a &quot;CODE&quot; field. This &quot;CODE&quot; prefix is
        used in combination with an additional codebook. Such
        codebooks contain all kinds of words, expressions or
        standard sentences, represented by a three-figure or
        four-figure code, depending on the codebook that is used.
        If, for example, &quot;245&quot; represents &quot;Request
        more information&quot; in the codebook, this would be
        encoded into &quot;0245&quot;. Always use the
        &quot;CODE&quot; prefix (in this example &quot;0&quot;)
        as prefix just before the actual code. When the receiver
        encounters the &quot;CODE&quot; prefix, he knows that he
        must decode the following three digits with the proper
        codebook into a word or phrase. The use of a codebook is
        optional but can reduce the message length considerably.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The top row with most frequently used
        English letters for this checkerboard is memorised by the
        words &quot;ON A TIE&quot; in alphabetic order. We can
        optimise this checkerboard for French by using, in
        alphabetic order, the letters from the word
        &quot;SAINTE&quot;. For German this would be &quot;ANREIS
        &quot;and for Spanish &quot;SENORA&quot;. This, of
        course, requires a different completion of the second and
        third row with the remaining letters.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The following checkerboard, also
        optimised for English, includes the most common English
        digraphs. This again reduces the required digits for
        certain words. </font></p>
        <p><img src="../pics/aeiot.gif" width="402" height="202"></p>
        <p><font size="2">The CT-37 table is another extended
        version of the straddling checkerboard that includes
        additional characters. The table is easy to remember. It
        uses the 7 most frequent English letters
        &quot;ESTONIA&quot; in the top row. The two following
        rows are the remaining letters, completed with the
        &quot;FIG&quot; (89) field. The fourth row contains the
        &quot;SPACE&quot; (90) and &quot;CODE&quot; (99) field
        with the punctuation marks between them (less critical to
        remember).</font></p>
        <p><img src="../pics/ct37.gif" width="402" height="162"></p>
        <p><font size="2">The CT-37-Words table uses a mix of
        letters, words and code. &quot;CODE&quot; (6) is a
        shortened prefix for fixed length codes. The commonly
        used words &quot;acknowledge&quot;, &quot;request&quot;,
        &quot;message&quot;, &quot;rendez-vous point&quot;,
        &quot;grid&quot; (coordinates), &quot;send&quot; and
        &quot;supply&quot; are respresented by a small two-digit
        code. Omitting one more top-row letter or the CODE field
        will give another full row which could held 10 more
        words, expressions or short sentences (CODE could be
        added to this new row). This approach can reduce the
        message length enormously if the set of two-digit
        expressions is selected carfully.</font></p>
        <p><img src="../pics/ct37w.jpg" width="402" height="202"></p>
        <p><font size="2">In the CT-46 encoding table, we can use
        four full rows since we have four unused digits in the
        top row. This encoding table is not that hard to
        memorize. In the first row the 6 most frequent letters
        AEINOR get the single digits. Each next row starts with
        the remaining digits 7, 8, 9 or 0. The second and third
        row are the remaining letters of the alphabet. The fourth
        row contains the &quot;SPC&quot;(90) and &quot;CODE&quot;
        (99) with the signs in between (less important to
        memorize). The fifth row are simply the numbers preceded
        by a zero.</font></p>
        <p><img src="../pics/ct46.gif" width="402" height="202"></p>
        <p><font size="2">The CT-55 table has even more
        additional characters. &quot;L/F&quot; (89) is used to
        switch from Letters (yellow) to Figures (green) and from
        Figures to Letters. This enables more characters with the
        same encoding value. The Red fields can be used in both
        Letters and Figures mode, thus a space, period, etc in a
        text doesn't require switching to Figures. Numbers are
        represented by its double code to exclude digit errors.
        An example: &quot;F-16B&quot; is encoded into 73 89 84 11
        66 89 70. &quot;CODE&quot; (91) is again used as a prefix
        for four-digit codes and &quot;RPT&quot; (92) is used to
        repeat important pieces of text. This encoding table has
        the 7 most frequent letters, optimized for English, and
        is suitable for text with more figures and signs.</font></p>
        <p><img src="../pics/ct55.gif" width="402" height="242"></p>
        <p><font size="2">Of course, there are many other ways to
        encode characters into digits. The system of encoding
        characters into digits doesn't need to be scrambled or
        secure in any way when one-time pad encryption provides
        the security. Any method to encode into digits is good,
        as long as it is practical, doesn't make the message too
        long and isn't prone to critical errors. The shown
        examples are easily adapted to anyone's specific
        purposes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>Scrambled Checkerboards</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">As explained before, checkerboards that
        are used in combination with an encryption method, other
        than one-time pad, preferably contain a scrambled
        alphabet or digits. This will strengthen the subsequent
        encryption considerably</font>. <font size="2">Note that
        there are far more possible ways to scramble the alphabet
        than to scramble 10 digits. Therefore, we will focus on
        creating keyword based scrambled alphabets that include
        optimised letter frequency for a given language.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Our first example uses two keywords and
        a double transposition. Let's use the keywords
        &quot;OVERTURE&quot; and &quot;INTERGALACTIC&quot;. A
        first matrix is created with the first keyword and filled
        with the normal alphabet. A second, for now empty matrix,
        is created with the second keyword. The letters of both
        keywords are numbered according to their order in the
        alphabet. Doe letters that occure more than once we
        assign the lowest number to the most-left letter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Read off the letters of the first
        matrix, column by column, as determined by the first
        keyword order, and fill the second matrix, row by row,
        with those letters. </font></p>

        with the scrambled letters, the marked most-frequent
        letters in the top row, followed by the remaining
        letters. If we use the &quot;AT-ONE-SIR&quot;

        <p><font size="2">Notice the completely different
        alphabets, created with the same two keywords but another
        transposition method. Although both methods create an
        excellent mix, it should be noted that the double
        transposition with two matrices creates the superior mix.
        Of course, these scrambled alphabets are useable for
        various differently formatted checkerboard and we could
        even fill the matrices with a mix of letters, digits,
        codes or punctuations.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On its own, these scrambled
        checkerboards constitue a monoalphabetic cipher, somewhat
        complicated by the irregular fractionation of the single
        and double digit combinations. This however will not
        provide any serious protection agains basic
        cryptalanysis, even by a novice codebreaker. It's real
        potential is only fully exploited when a text, encoded
        with a scrambled checkerboard, is followed by a double
        transposition of the plaincode digits. A final increase
        of complexity is achieved if one or both of the these
        transpositions are disrupted. This combination creates
        one of the most powerfull manual cipher system that
        exist. This is due to the suppression of high frequency
        letters in combination with the highly irregular
        fractionation of the digit combinations by the two
        transpositions. Note that the matrices of this subcequent
        duoble transposition should preferably be unequal in
        width, one of even and one of odd width, and at least 15
        to 20 columns wide. Remember, it's not required to
        scrambled a checkerboard when the encoded message is
        followed by one-time pad encryption, as this type of
        encryption provides absolute security on its own.</font></p>
