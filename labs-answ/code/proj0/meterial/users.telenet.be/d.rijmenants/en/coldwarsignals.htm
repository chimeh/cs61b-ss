                <p><font size="2">An important part of the Cold
                War was fought over radio waves and this battle
                continues to this day. All kinds of radio signals
                are transmitted, from communication signals in
                voice, Morse or data, to technical signals such
                as radar, navigation and radio jamming.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Especially during the Cold War,
                the arms race and the need for intelligence
                fueled a rapid development of sophisticated
                electronics. The interception and analysis of
                enemy signals became just as important as the
                performance and protection of one's own signals.
                Signals intelligence (SIGINT), the gathering of
                intelligence by interception of signals,
                comprises two main parts: communications
                intelligence (COMINT) and electronic intelligence
                (ELINT).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">COMINT focuses on voice, Morse
                and data communications to retrieve the content
                of the messages, the identity and location of the
                person, organisation or unit that broadcast, and
                the broadcast frequencies and schedules. These
                communications are often encrypted to protect
                them from eavesdropping, requiring cryptanalysis
                to make them readable. Even when all
                cryptanalytic attacks fail, information can still
                be extracted by traffic analysis, the deduction
                of information from patterns in the
                communications (message size and volume, time,
                location).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">ELINT comprises the
                interception and analysis of signals from weapons
                systems, navigation, guidance and radar systems,
                to find out which systems the opponent uses, how
                the equipment works and how it performs. Goal is
                to know the opponent's capabilities, his order of
                battle, and to develop electronic counter
                measures (ECM) against his equipment. The
                opponent, on the other hand, will develop
                electronic counter-counter measures (ECCM), for
                instance encryption or frequency hopping, to
                prevent exploitation or jamming of his systems.</font></p>

                West</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">In today&#146;s world of global
                communications, the Internet and freedom of
                travel, we tend to forget that, only a few years
                ago, there were two separated worlds on this
                planet: the East and the West. Until the fall of
                the Berlin Wall in 1989, East and West
                weren&#146;t merely geographically expressions.
                Almost every country on the globe had taken side,
                willingly or not. The Cold War raged over the
                world for almost 45 years and it was often far
                from cold in many Asian, African, Middle Eastern
                and South American countries.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The separation of these two
                worlds was nowhere more visible than on the
                border between Western Europe and the Soviet
                Union, the co-called Iron Curtain. It was a
                border that few were allowed to cross and
                on-the-spot intelligence gathering was a very
                risky business. Consequently, for decades, little
                was known about the opponent and huge efforts
                were made to retrieve even the smallest piece of
                military, political or economical information
                from 'the other side'. These were the heydays of
                espionage, intelligence agencies and SIGINT
                organisations.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Both the West and the Soviet
                Union had build up huge armies with an enormous
                arsenal. The skies were crowded with various
                signals and SIGINT was an ideal method to collect
                information from a &#150; relatively &#150; safe
                distance. Huge resources and a lot of money were
                spent to intercept each others signals. Both
                sides deployed many mobile and fixed intercept
                stations. <br>

                intercepted information could not be read because
                it was encrypted. The introduction of digital
                systems made possible the development of far more
                complex encryption schemes.</font><p><font
                size="2">Nevertheless, both the Western countries
                and the Soviets still had their successes. A key
                factor in breaking encrypted signals was to
                collect enough data. More data means more
                statistical information for the mathematicians
                who attack the codes. Both the United States and
                the Soviet Union had plenty of the brightest
                mathematicians. Now they just needed plenty of
                data. No problem!</font></p>

                are renowed. During the Cold War, ASA and later
                NSA operated important SIGINT stations in
                Germany, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, some
                of which are still operational. In Germany, the
                frontier of the Cold War, some well known
                examples were the American SIGINT Field Station
                Berlin on top of Teufelsberg and ASA Det J in

                share in the worldwide eavesdropping competition
                with, among others, SIGINT stations at Lourdes in
                Cuba, Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, near Tallinn in
                Estland and in South Yemen. They also had several
                stations in East Germany, such as the Yenisei and
                Urian listening posts in Brocken. The GRU
                (military intelligence), the KGB's 16th
                Directorat (interception of communications and
                Signal Intelligence) and 8th Main Directorat
                (communication and cryptography) did their part
                in processing the intercepted traffic. They also
                operate a large satellite network for
                interception and communications and have a large
                number of intercept stations around the world.</font></p>

                Nonetheless, even some smaller countries were
                more than capable. The HVA, the East German
                foreign intelligence service under control of the
                Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (Stasi), was
                well known and feared for its excellent espionage
                capabilities by human intelligence (HUMINT) with
                an enormous number of agents operating in the
                West. However, for decades, their technical
                capabilities were heavily underestimated.</font><p><font
                size="2">After the dissolving of the German
                Democratic Republic, it became clear that the
                Stasi SIGINT directorat HA III had 25
                departments, over 2000 staff officers and some 80
                installations in East Germany. They monitored
                shortwave transmissions and more than 30,000 West
                German telephones from military, diplomatic and
                intelligence personnel from both West Germany and
                NATO. They eavesdropped on radio signal paths
                (telephone) used by the Federal Post Office, and
                on VHF radios of the BND (West German
                intelligence) surveillance teams. Virtually all
                West German satellite-based telephone, Telex,
                fax, and data transmissions were monitored.</font></p>

                Short range signals (VHF, radar, missile
                guidance) often required interception from closer
                distances. Airborne SIGINT and ELINT platforms
                constantly patrolled close to and often even
                beyond enemy borders to eavesdrop on their
                signals . These were most dangerous missions,
                even in peacetime. Many of the crews never
                returned home.</font><p><font size="2">The

                few well known of over 40 U.S. aircraft that were
                lost. These reconnaissance programs were top
                secret and the public usually never knew about
                these losses. Other welll know U.S. SIGINT
                platforms were the RC-135, the EA-3B and EA-6B.
                The famous Soviet TU-95 and TU-142 were also

                notorious and most damaging for U.S.
                communications security. The Soviet spy trailers
                were also regular visitors in Western coastal
                waters. Some naval SIGINT operations were most
                daring. In 1971, during operation Ivy Bells, the
                nuclear U.S. submarine USS Halibut placed a 6 ton

                ELINT, COMINT or espionage. However, despite huge
                efforts and risks, some signals remained
                unidentified and some of them even rose to the
                stardom of mysterious Cold War signals. These
                signals also caught the attention of both
                Intelligence organisations and civilian radio
                amateurs. There was much speculation about the
                purpose of these signals, some of which were in
                voice or Morse, others were strange analogue or
                digital transmissions that lasted for decades.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Once such station was nicknamed
                the Russian Woodpecker, because of its
                characteristic repetitive tapping noise. The
                Woodpecker's annoying high-power signal (an
                estimated 10 Megawatt) switched between different
                shortwave frequencies and disrupted legitimate
                utility and amateur broadcasts all over the
                world. The broadcast started in 1976 and
                continued for 10 years. For decades, its purpose
                remained unknown to the general public.</font><font

                <td valign="top"><font size="2">After the fall of
                the Soviet Union it was confirmed that the
                strange signal originated from an
                over-the-horizon (OTH) radar as part of the
                Soviet Anti Ballistic Missile early warning
                system. The enormous antenna of the Duga-3 OTH
                system is located in Chernobyl (now Ukraine). The
                transmitter site, called Chernobyl-2, was
                codenamed Steel Yard by Western military
                intelligence, who apparently managed to
                photograph the transmitter site during the Cold
                War. Noteworthy is that site now lays within the
                18 miles Chernobyl exclusion zone, adding to its
                mystery status.</font><p><font size="2">The
                United States also had their part in
                long-distance snooping by developing the MELODY
                system, a so-called bistatic interception that
                uses objects like the Soviet's own missiles, or
                even the moon, to reflect radar signals over very
                large distance, far beyond the horizon. This
                enabled tracking and analysis of remote radar
                locations inside Russia.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Another famous Soviet signal is
                known under its call-sign UVB-76. The station,
                nicknamed the Buzzer, started broadcast in 1982
                with a two-second beep tone and switched, after a
                decade of operation, to a monotonous 25 buzz
                tones per minute. Continuously, every hour, every
                single day, year after year. The station is
                extensively observed by radio amateurs (without
                doubt an equally monotonous job) and only a
                handful of voice conversations were ever recorded
                in its 28 years of operation. Its call-sign
                UVB-76 was revealed during one of its rare voice
                conversations. The station, which apparently
                relocated in 2010, is currently known under its
                new callsign UVB-76 / MDZhB. The purpose of The
                Buzzer remains unknown until today.</font></p>

                Some believe that the Buzzer simply occupies
                certain frequencies to have them available in
                case of a crisis or war. Others believe that the
                uninterrupted signal is part of the notorious
                so-called Dead Hand, an autonomous launch system
                for clusters of nuclear missile sites that
                supposedly would be activated if the signal was
                interrupted, due to elimination of Soviet
                military command by an American first strike. As
                we now know, the dead hand systems did actually
                exist, but the relation between UVB-76 and the
                doomsday system is nothing more than pure
                speculation. Nevertheless, the few interrupts of
                the signal did raise some eyebrows at the time.</font><p><font
                size="2">Another true Cold War icon is, of
                course, the notorious numbers station. These
                stations broadcast streams of numbers or letters
                in voice or Morse, and these unlicensed and
                officially non-existing stations are transmitting
                since many decades. During the Cold War, there
                was much speculation by radio amateurs who
                intercepted these mysterious messages. Some
                believed these were spy stations, but governments
                denied their existence or claimed them to be
                weather signals, buoys or beacons. Today,
                there&#146;s plenty of evidence, from spy case
                court documents and archives, that they are
                indeed encrypted messages, send by intelligence
                agencies to their agents in the field. Mostly,
                these messages are encrypted with the unbreakable
                one-time pad system. Although the Cold War
                officially ended, there are still many active
                numbers stations and new keep popping up, sending
                messages in many different languages. Who is
                listening to them remains a mystery. More about
