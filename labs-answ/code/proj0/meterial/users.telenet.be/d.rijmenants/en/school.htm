        The story</font> </h2>

        align="right" hspace="0" width="320" height="220"></font><font
        size="2">The story of the Enigma is a combination of
        technology, military history and the mysterious world of
        espionage, code breakers and intelligence. As it happens,
        these are the perfect ingredients to attract the
        attention of young people. Therefore Enigma provides the
        perfect subject to stimulate students to explore maths
        and WW2 history.</font> </p>
        <h2><font size="2">Boring School Stuff</font> </h2>
        <p><font size="2">Imagine the response of your 12 year
        old pupils if you tell them that you're going to talk
        about the Second World War and the invasion of Poland.
        Exactly, they start falling in a coma! But what if you
        start by telling about a code machine on German U-boats?
        What about top secret missions to capture code books? And
        students, picked out of college to work on the largest
        and utmost secret code breaking project ever in Bletchley
        Park? What if your pupils where code breakers? What
        skills would they need to crack top secret German codes?
        You will have all eyes and ears in your classroom!</font>
        </p>
        <h2><font size="2">Fun With History</font> </h2>
        <p><font size="2">The story of the Enigma machine is
        ideal to get your students interested. As they dive into
        this story, they will discover amazing wartime stories.
        Of course, once interested in that Polish top ace
        codebreaker, it's a small leap to the invasions of
        Poland. Once they know about the U-boat communications
        and how Bletchley Park located these iron sharks, it's a
        small step to the history of naval warfare. The whole war
        was influenced by information, codenamed ULTRA, retrieved
        by cracking German codes. ULTRA played a decisive role in
        the Atlantic, in Africa, Russia and during D-day. How
        many young people know about the importance of the
        battles in Africa or know the desert fox, Field Marshal
        Erwin Rommel? Or how and why Germany invaded the Soviet
        Union?</font> </p>
        <h2><font size="2">Useful Maths</font> </h2>
        <p><font size="2">But it's not all about history! Maths
        played a crucial role in breaking the codes. Enigma is
        the perfect way to show your students that maths can make
        the difference! Brilliant people like Alan Turing and Max
        Newton, founders of computer history, were ace code
        breakers in Bletchley Park, England. And it all started
        with maths! How many possible combinations are there to
        place the rotors of the machine? And the number of plug
        combinations? How much more complicated is a four rotor
        Kriegsmarine Enigma to crack than a three rotor version?
        It doesn't even have to be Enigma all the time. There are
        many pencil-and-paper codes, which can be broken by some
        simple methods like letter frequency analysis. And we
        even didn't talk about the Colossus, the first computer
        ever, build to crack German messages, encrypted with the
        Lorenz machine. It was so secret that people believed for
        decades that the American ENIAC was the first ever
        computer.</font> </p>
        <h2><font size="2">Do It!</font> </h2>
        <p><font size="2">If you're interested in using the story
        of Enigma in your school, this website is a great place
        to start collecting information on this subject. Of
        course, there are many other sources, especially on WW2
        history, and I have put in many links to other
        interesting information. You can get a taste of code
        breaking excitement by visiting my </font><a
        href="challenge.htm"><font size="2">Enigma Cipher
        Challenge</font></a><font size="2"> which might be a
        great class project. As you progress through the stages
        and break new messages, the message content reveils more
        and more pieces of actual wartime history. Some of the
        most important moments in WW2 are captured in these
        encrypted messages! Googeling around on names of
        operations, persons or ships in these messages will bring
        up some thrilling stories, straight from the war zone!
        Let your students crack the codes and let them
        investigate on the history from a particular message. Of
        course, there are many other ways to compile an
        interesting project or some fun hours in your class. If
        you have any questions regarding the Enigma or other
        cipher machines and their role in wartime history I will
        be pleased to help you with your school project. Just </font><a
