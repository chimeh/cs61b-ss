        <h4 align="left"><font size="2">The Codebreakers: The
        Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from
        Ancient Times to the Internet - David Kahn</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/codebreakers.jpg"
        align="left" border="1" hspace="4" width="110"
        height="170"></font><font size="2">The Codebreakers is
        the ultimate reference on the history of cryptology. This
        book is indispensable on the book shelf of anyone who is
        interested in the making and breaking of codes, and how
        it influenced history. David Kahn takes you on a trip
        through history that spans almost 4000 years and he does
        this in a very detailed, extensive and sometimes exciting
        way. Giving a summary of the book is almost impossible,
        considering the huge wealth of information. The first
        chapter starts in 1941 and describes chronologically the
        events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbour, and the
        work of OP-20-G, the U.S. Navy&#146;s cryptologic
        organization. This 70 pages introduction immediately
        makes clear what cryptography is about, and how it
        influences history. This gripping first chapter puts you
        in the front seat of history and makes you want to ride
        straight through Kahn&#146;s massive 1000-pager.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The story of cryptology starts in 2000
        B.C. and the book traces its origins, from the first
        hieroglyphs, over the early Arabic work on cryptanalysis
        to the middle ages. Western civilization would have to
        wait until the 14th century before secret writing
        gradually developed in the hands of people like di
        Lavinde, Soro and Porta, and the first book on
        cryptography, Trithemius&#146; Polygaphyiae. Kahn brings
        alive the stories from monks, popes, kings, espionage and
        treason, and he explains how all the classical ciphers
        work and how they were broken. In the 17th century,
        codebreaking became a powerful tool in the hands of
        people like Antoine Rossignol and John Wallis. The era of
        the black chambers, how they worked, their achievements,
        decrypting communications from friend and foe to assist
        politics and diplomacy, it&#146;s all there. Various
        nomenclatures, codebooks and ciphers are presented.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Cryptology moved from a mysterious dark
        art to real science in the 19th century. The invention of
        telegraphy evoked an explosion of communications.
        Jefferson, Wheatstone, and Babbage, the American Civil
        War and conflicts in Europe lead to the invention of many
        so-called field ciphers, extensively used by the
        military. Auguste Kerckhoffs, Etienne Bazieres and many
        others contributed to the mechanization of cryptography
        by writing books or inventing crypto machines. The many
        conflicts in the early 1900&#146;s showed the need for
        specialized military organizations, not only to implement
        cryptographic systems, but also to intercept and decipher
        enemy communications. Radio communications became
        widespread and so did the commercial market of crypto
        machines. The war of intercepts had started. Kahn
        describes in detail cipher systems, how and where they
        performed on the battlefields during World War I, and how
        the United States finally catches up with the European
        continent, thanks to people like Herbert Yardley and
        William Friedman. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">During the Second World War,
        cryptanalysis finally evolved from raw intelligence into
        a vital part of modern warfare. Examples are innumerable,
        and Kahn does a wonderful job in bringing alive the many
        war episodes that were determined by the making and
        breaking of codes. Signals intelligence kept playing a
        major role during the Cold War, and Kahn devotes a
        complete chapter on Russian cryptology, returning to its
        origins in the 18th century and explains how they
        developed into a key player the Cold War, with the
        according espionage stories. The history and work of NSA
        (National Security Agency) is followed by the anatomy of
        cryptology, and a detour to the use of ciphers and codes
        by the American rum runners during the prohibition years,
        gamblers and businessman. Kahn also peeks into the past,
        with the deciphering of ancient languages, and briefly
        peeks into the future with communications with outer
        space.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The book was published in 1967 and
        therefore did not contain any recently declassified
        information about, for instance, the breaking of the
        German Enigma machine, the expansion from cryptography
        into the public domain, the Internet or the evolution of
        signals intelligence. The 1996 edition contains an
        additional 15 page short chapter which merely touches
        these subjects. However, given the many detailed books,
        published today about these more recent, there is no need
        for an extensive revision of the book. With 27 chapters
        and 1180 pages (of which 194 pages notes and references)
        the book is already a massive read. Although the book
        also presents some classical cryptologic techniques, it
        is not a technical work for cryptologists or
        mathematicians. David Kahn&#146;s The Codebreakers is a
        unique one-in-a-kind reference on the history of
        cryptology with numerous exciting stories that will
        captivate even those who never heard of cryptology.
        Highly recommended! ISBN 0684831309 <br clear="all">

        <h4 align="left"><font size="2">Secret Power: New
        Zealand&#146;s Role in the International Spy Network -
        Nicky Hager</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/secretpower.jpg"
        align="left" border="1" hspace="4" width="110"
        height="170"></font><font size="2">Secret Power (now free
        to download as e-book) is a fascinating book about New
        Zealand's role in the international UKUSA based spy
        network. Published in 1996 but hardly known to the
        public, the book is one of the first well documented
        papers to shed a light on the most secret ECHELON system.
        The story begins after the Second World War, when the
        United States and the United Kingdom sign the UKUSA
        agreement, to gather and share Signals Intelligence
        (SIGINT). Soon after, Canada, Australia and New Zealand
        joined this cooperation. This was to become the largest
        worldwide SIGINT organisation ever. The boek provides
        many details about the origings and history of the New
        Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB),
        their collaboration with the other SIGINT agencies and
        the how and why of the most secretive UKUSA agreement. In
        the 1980s, a system was introduced to automatically
        categorise, filter and store the vast amount of
        intercepted signals from commercial satellites, radio
        communications, telephone, fax, Telex and e-mail traffic.
        The system, codenamed ECHELON became an enormous source
        of intelligence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Although apparently a child of the Cold
        War, ECHELON does much more than protecting the
        participating countries against the - meanwhile perished
        - Soviet Union or safeguarding their nations interests.
        It enables massive eavesdropping on both enemies and
        friends, and for many years, this was done without
        consent or knowledge of the New Zealand parliament.
        ECHELON was so secret that only the GCSB staff knew -
        more ore less - what they were doing. Moreover, the
        technology, training and key staff members were provided
        by the American NSA and the British GCHQ, the UKUSA key
        members. ECHELON is based on software, called Dictionary,
        to filter potential interesting information with the help
        of key words. The five countries can individually compose
        and adjust different key word tables to filter out the
        intelligence they need. ECHELON also interconnects all
        the listening stations, located across the world. All
        five countries harvest intelligence and - theoretically -
        profit of the remote spy stations of their fellow
        eavesdroppers. However, the 'return on investment' for
        junior members Australia, Canada and New Zealand is
        nothing compared to their British GCHQ counterpart and
        especially the NSA, the agency that designed and fully
        controles the ECHELON system and its Dictionary. At the
        end, New Zealand embarked on a Big Brother project
        without being aware of what ECHELON was used for, what
        information the key players filtered out the GCSB
        stations, and without having any democratic control over
        this most secret operation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The information in the book is based
        many years of painstakingly puzzling together the very
        scarce information, tracking involved personnel and
        interviews with staff members of the GCSB. A quest that
        started in 1984 and lasted until the 1996 publishing of
        the book. The result is a detailed report on how the spy
        network and ECHELON are working, who is targeted and what
        information they harvest. Hager's investigations provide
        an insight view, not only in GCSB's kitchen, but also in
        the GCHQ, the NSA and the Australian DSD. A truly
        fascinating book! The e-book version, a 23 Mb pdf file,

        H. Keith Melton</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/spybook-en.jpg"
        align="left" border="1" hspace="4" width="110"
        height="170"></font><font size="2">Keith Melton is a well
        known author of several spy books and an expert on
        espionage equipment and clandestine devices. He has an
        enormous collection of these unique spy tools. This book
        is beautifully illustrated with more than 600 detailed
        images of ingenious spy accessories and weapons. The book
        starts with a brief historical review on the beginnings
        of espionage, the First World War and the Russian
        revolution. Melton takes us back to the Second World War,
        with the British SOE - Special Operations Executive , the
        American OSS - Office of Strategic Operations and the
        German Abwehr, Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo. The covert
        communications equipment, suitcase radios, special
        weapons, the cracking of codes and Soviet wartime spy
        rings.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">However, the major part of the book is,
        not surprisingly, about the Cold War. The Cold War was a
        period in history that was characterised by mistrust and
        fear between East and West. These were the heydays of
        espionage, with Berlin as the capital of spies. Many of
        the most notorious spy cases were about the battle for
        intelligence information between the United States and
        the Soviet Union during the Cold War. This battle was
        fought in the sky, with U2 spy planes and satellites, but
        also on the ground by intelligence officers and their
        agents in enemy territory. Hidden and automatic cameras
        for observation such as the Robot Star, small mini
        cameras like the famous Minox or the F21 with its lens in
        a jacket button for clandestine photography and small
        camera systems to copy documents. You will discover
        communications equipment for covert operations,
        monitoring equipment and dead drops to secretly pass
        documents and films.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Melton also brings us the story of
        secret operations and the special devices that were
        developed for these operations. If there are spies,
        there's counter-intelligence. Bug detectors,
        anti-eavesdropping equipment, interception of documents
        and all kind of tools to burgle or secretly gain access
        to installations or documents of the enemy. Training and
        recruitment, spy rings, false covers and legends, it's
        all there. But above all, <em>The Ultimate Spy</em> is a
        book to watch, with many splendid photos about the art of
        spy-craft and its technology. A book that would make
        James Bond's Mister Q jealous. ISBN: 0789404435 <br>

        <h4><font size="2">IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic
        Alliance between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful
        Corporation - Edwin Black</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/ibmholocaust.gif"
        align="left" hspace="4" width="110" height="170"></font><font
        size="2">How was it possible for the Nazis to identify
        such an enormous number of Jews and other ethnic groups?
        How did they find all their relatives? How did they
        manage to transport and eliminate millions of people? The
        answer to these questions begins in the early 1930s, when
        IBM successfully commercialized and aggressively
        monopolized the Hollerith punch card technology, used
        since 1890 by census bureaus. When Thomas Watson became
        president of IBM, his goal was to expand the company on a
        global scale, regardless any political, military or ethic
        obstacle. A crucial player in the organisation of the
        Holocaust was Dehomag, a German sub-company of IBM.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Hollerith machines, the predecessor
        of the computer, were able to perform statistical
        calculations and organise data with an unmatched speed.
        Already in the early 1930s the Nazis placed large orders
        at Dehomag to organise industry, finances, railways but
        also to automate the identification of Jews. All
        Hollerith machines had to be customised for every
        specific task and special punch cards were designed to
        store detailed information. Although the Germany based
        Demohag company officially processed these orders, it
        were the IBM engineers who controlled the complete
        process, and all financial decisions were made by IBM New
        York and its executives. Even when Jews were openly
        prosecuted and deported, even when war broke out, even
        when all trade with Germany became illegal, IBM continued
        to produce and lease Hollerith machines, developed custom
        solutions for the Nazis, offered maintenance and gained
        massive profits of this, of course hidden in a labyrinth
        of confusing financial and legal tricks.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Given the complex requirements to
        develop specific custom solutions, which included
        detailed data input and question lists, IBM was well
        aware of the purpose of the ordered machines. Moreover,
        IBM was constantly involved in legal battles to obtain
        more and more profit of its successful sub-company
        Dehomag. Meanwhile, Hollerith machines produced precise
        address lists of Jews in Germany and many occupied
        countries, organised their deportation and enslaved
        labor, enabled smooth railway timetables to transport
        millions of people across Europe and boosted the
        efficiency of the German war industry. And IBM was the
        one who leased the machines and produces the billions of
        punch cards Hitler needed to continue his war and the
        total annihilation of Jews. This book shows in detail the
        carefully constructed covert alliance between IBM and the
        Third Reich, and how IBM founder and president Thomas
        Watson cooperated with the Nazis. It's not an easy book
        to read, but an astonishing report on how a globalised
        company ignored moral ethics, laws and borders for the
        sake of profit. Above all, this book answers the most
        important question: how did Hitler get the names of all
        these Jews? ISBN: 0609607995 <br>

        size="2">The story of Kim Philby, head of the Soviet
        counter-espionage section of the SIS, Britain's Secret
        Intelligence Service, at the same time a successful
        Russian spy. This brilliant student became a true
        communist in Cambridge. In 1933 he finished his
        university studies and went to Vienna to help underground
        socialists in their battle against the Austrian
        right-conservatives. After his return Philby was
        recruited by the KGB as one of 'the four of Cambridge',
        together with Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony
        Blunt. His main objective was to infiltrate the SIS. He
        went to Spain as newspaper reporter and pretended to be a
        supporter of the fascist General Franco, to erase his
        communist past. In 1940 he was recruited by the SIS after
        recommendation by the already infiltrated Burgess and one
        year later he worked at the counter-espionage branch. By
        the end of 1944, at the dawn of the Cold War, he had been
        promoted to head of counter-espionage and anti-communist
        operations. Five years later he was promoted to the SIS
        top function in Washington which gave him access to US
        operations against the Soviet-Union, the top secret
        VENONA project, and other sensitive information.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">After the defection of his close
        friends Burgess and Maclean to Moscow, he came under
        suspicion with MI5 and got fired. Due to lack of evidence
        his name was cleared and by 1956 he was covertly
        recruited again by the SIS as agent in Beirut. After the
        defection of KGB agent Golitsyn his treason was exposed
        and the SIS proposed exemption of prosecution in exchange
        of a full confession. However, early in 1963 Philby
        vanished in Lebanon to surface a few weeks later in
        Moscow, where he was received as a hero. The performance
        of this master spy is unique and for almost 30 years
        caused enormous damage in the hart of the battle against
        Soviet Intelligence. This book is based on many
        interviews with Philby himself in Moscow, and has been
        veryfied by historical research. ISBN: 0233000488<br>

        to read. The book is written in chronological order and
        starts at the roots of the secret service. Katamidze
        takes us on a journey through time, from Dzerzhinsky's
        ruthless Cheka, the OGPU and NKVD, the repression by the
        KGB inside and outside the Soviet Union during the Cold
        War, to the the failed 1991 coup by Kryuchkov with the
        dissolving of the KGB and transition to the new Federal
        Security Service FSB and Foreign Intelligence SVR in the
        new Russian Federation. Katamidze doesn't hide his
        criticism on the secret services and their violent
        history. Many of the most notorious spy cases and KGB
        intelligence successes are described and you can find
        details about nearly all high ranked people in the secret
        service, all of this illustrated with many unique images.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Having said this, I also have some
        serious questions about this book. Although a very good
        introduction, it fails to go into detail on several
        important episodes in the history of the Soviet Union and
        its secret service. The author presents some new and
        questionable facts about names and numbers, criticises
        some people and is striking mild on others. The book
        regretfully lacks the sources for these new facts, giving
        the book a sense of subjectivity, although it's hard to
        tell in which direction. Slava Katamidze has a background
        as officer in the Soviet Army, studied at the institute
        for foreign languages and institute for international law
        in Moscow. Sounds like a perfect candidate for the GRU
        (military intelligence, known for its fierce rivalry with
        the KGB). Although nowhere mentioned and only an educated
        guess of mine, it would explanation the duality of the
        book in its criticism on the secret service and at the
        same time forgetting some dark Soviet episodes and
        details. Nonetheless a fascinating introduction and
        beautiful illustrated book. However, I recommend to read
        books such as <em>The Mitrokhin Archive</em> after this
        one, to get another view on the story. ISBN: 1930983239<br>

        size="2">Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin was a chief archivist
        for the First Chief Directorate PGU, the
        foreign-intelligence department of the KGB, when the huge
        archive relocated to another KGB building. Mitrokhin was
        responsible for transferring over 300,000 files, many of
        them among the KGB's most secret documents. Over a period
        of 12 years, Mitrokhin smuggled a vast amount of top
        secret papers out of the archive and copied them. In
        1992, he walked into a British embassy in a Baltic state
        and by the end of that year he was exfiltrated by British
        Secret Service, together with several large crates of
        documents. The consequences were devastating for the KGB.
        Details about secret operations and the names and code
        names of Soviet spies came into the hands of intelligence
        services in the West. As the facts got published, SVR,
        the successor to the KGB, replied that it was simply
        impossible that hundreds of names could be exposed, 'in
        worst case a few'. The reality was that more than one
        thousand names were revealed. This enabled secret
        services to identify or catch many Soviet spies. This
        large book contains an enormous amount of information on
        the history of the secret services in the Soviet Union
        and detailed info on Soviet spies and numerous secret
        operations. ISBN: 0465003125</font><br clear="all">

        Ever since the beginning of mankind, people have had
        secrets, and people have wanted to know other peoples
        secrets. This book takes the reader on a trip through the
        history of cryptology, from ancient texts through to
        modern cryptographic algorithms on computers. Singh
        explains the evolution of codemakers, and their never
        ending battle with codebreakers. Without going into
        technical details he shows the importance of cryptology
        in politics and war over many centuries. We read how
        cryptography was developed as an important weapon against
        Signal Intelligence, and the role of codebreakers in
        Sigint. In this age of technology, internet and
        communication, Singh explains the importance of
        encryption to protect our privacy. This isn't a detailed
        book aimed at crypto geeks, but a good introduction to
        cryptography with some basics on classical encryption
        methods and a bit of theory on modern algorithms like
        RSA. This book is a must for those who think that
        encryption isn't important. ISBN: 0385495323<br

        size="2">A detailed book about the Abwehr, the German
        Foreign Intelligence organization before and during the
        Second World War. Farago, a former SIS officer,
        reconstructed the history of this notorious service
        thanks to recovered archives, captured in the final days
        of war. They contained tens of thousands of documents on
        microfilm. The book explains how the Abwehr was formed,
        how Admiral Canaris developed it into an effective secret
        service, and his struggle with the other German security
        services. We can read about the preparations for war and
        the invasion of Poland, as well as the spy networks in
        England, the success of the British counter-intelligence
        and the Double-Cross system that turned virtually all
        German agents in England into double agents. There's a
        large chapter on pre-war industrial and military
        espionage and sabotage by German spy networks in the US.
        You can read how the Abwehr tried to influence US
        elections and prevent a third term for F. D. Roosevelt,
        who was in favor of military support for Europe. The
        archives reveal the misplaced confidence in the Abwehr
        agents operating in the US, and how the FBI eliminated
        most of the spy networks once the US entered the war. The
        archives show the infiltration of foreign embassies, the
        spy network in neutral Sweden and the support for General
        Franco in Spain.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1944 the Abwehr finally lost all
        credit with the Nazi top brass, in favor of Schellenbergs
        Sicherheidsdienst Ausland, and Admiral Canaris was forced
        to leave the service. The Allied success of operation
        Fortitude, to mislead German intelligence about the
        invasion on D-Day, was the last major battle between the
        secret services and finally lead to the fall of the Nazi
        empire. The question remains in how far Canaris, who
        became anti-Nazi, was responsible for the failure of his
        intelligence service and the outcome of war. The Abwehr,
        by then under command of the RSHA, soon collapsed without
        the expertise of Canaris who was executed later by the SS
        in Kamp Flossenburg for conspiracy against Hitler. This
        detailed story of the recovered Abwehr archive is a
        unique piece of WW2 intelligence history. ISBN:

        size="2">Markus Wolf was the legendary chief of the HVA
        (Haupt Verwaltung Aufklaerung), East Germany's foreign
        intelligence service. Wolf, the son of writer and
        physician Friedrich Wolf and brother of film director
        Konrad Wolf, fled as child in 1933 from the Nazi's and
        exiled himself to Moscow. After the war, he was sent to
        Berlin as journalist for the radio station in the Soviet
        Zone of occupation. As a journalist, he followed the
        Nuremberg Trials against the Nazi leaders.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1953, he was one of the founding
        members of the foreign intelligence service, a department
        of the ministry of state security, also called Stasi. As
        head of the HVA, Wolf developed the most effective secret
        service of the Cold War. After retiring in 1986, he wrote
        a book which was originally a film project of his late
        brother Konrad, about Konrad and two friends, growing up
        in Moscow in the 1930s. Konrad joined the Soviet Army,
        one friend joined the German Luftwaffe, and the third one
        joined the US forces. After the war, the three friends
        meet again and keep in contact. The book, Die Troika, a
        statement for friendship which also exposed the failure
        of communism, was published in East and West Germany. For
        the people in the East, Wolf, who supported Glasnost and
        Perestroika, became a symbol of the ongoing changes in a
        country that rejected the changes in Eastern Europe.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Although Wolf headed only the foreign
        intelligence, one of many departments of Erich Mielke's
        Stasi, he became targeted as Stasi spy chief by the media
        during the period of the fall of the Berlin Wall. After
        the collapse of the German Democratic Republic, Wolf was
        charged and sentenced in the reunified Germany with
        espionage, bribery and treason, but that conviction was
        later overturned and he received a suspended sentence on
        lesser charges.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In the book <strong>The Man Without a
        Face</strong> (ISBN: 1891620126), you can read about his
        childhood years in Moscow, the development of the most
        successful spy agency of the Cold War, and lots of inside

        1939, the Government Code and Cipher School, GC&amp;CS,
        started a top secret station to decipher intercept enemy
        codes. Some of the most brilliant people were brought
        together in Bletchley Park, England. One of their
        objectives was breaking the Enigma codes. The Enigma
        cipher machine was used in all parts of the German Army,
        Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. Breaking this code could turn
        the tide of the war. This book is the story of the people
        who broke the code, how the codebreaking was organised,
        and gives us a pretty good idea of how people lived in
        Bletchley Park. Breaking Enigma played a decisive role in
        many parts of the war such as the Atlantic, Africa and
        D-day, and shortened the war by several years. ISBN:
