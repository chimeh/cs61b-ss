        The story of the famous Enigma cipher machine combines
        ingenious technology, military history and the mysterious
        world of espionage, codebreakers and intelligence into a
        real thriller. Never before has the fate of so many lives
        been so influenced by one cryptographic machine, as in
        the Second World War. Enigma is the most famous and
        appealing example of the battle between codemakers and
        codebreakers. Enigma showed the importance of
        cryptography to military and civil intelligence. </font></p>

                <p><font size="2">The need for secure
                communications for both military as civilian use
                became obvious in the early 1900s, with the rise
                of wireless communication. The search to replace
                the impractical and time-consuming hand ciphers
                began. In 1917, the American Edward Hugh Hebern
                developed a cipher machine with rotating disks,
                each disk performing a substitution cipher.
                Hebern's idea was the base for many similar
                machines, developed in several other countries.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In 1918, Engineer Arthur
                Scherbius patented a cipher machine using rotors.
                The German Navy and Foreign Offices were
                approached, but were not interested. In 1923, the
                rights for the patents went to
                Chiffriermaschinen-AG, a firm with Scherbius on
                the board of directors, that commercialized the
                machine. In 1927, Scherbius bought the 1919
                patent from of a similar machine from the
                Dutchman Koch, in order to secure his own patent,
                approved in 1925.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The first cipher machine,
                Enigma A, came onto the market in 1923. It was a
                large and heavy machine with an integrated
                typewriter and weighed about 50 Kg. Soon after
                the Enigma B was introduced, a very similar
                machine. The weight and size of these machines
                made them unattractive for military use. The
                development of the reflector, an idea of
                Scherbius' colleague Willi Korn, made it possible
                to design the compact and much lighter Enigma C.
                Also, the type writer part was replaced by a lamp
                panel. In 1927, the Enigma D was introduced and
                commercialized in several versions with different
                rotor wirings, and sold across Europe to military
                and diplomatic services. The Enigma D had three
                normal rotors and one reflector that could be set
                in one of the 26 positions. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Several intelligence services
                succeeded in breaking the civil and military
                Enigma versions which were all based on the
                commercial D. The Enigma D had no plugboard, a
                military feature that would increase security
                considerably from 1935 onwards. The Italian Navy
                bought the commercial Enigma D, as did Spain
                during the Spanish Civil War. The Swiss army used
                the Enigma K, a slightly modified version of the
                Enigma D. Japan used the Enigma T, also called
                Tirpiz Enigma, an adapted Enigma D with modified
                entry rotor connections. Japan also developed
                their own version of the T, with horizontally
                placed rotors. The messages of both models T and
                K were broken as well. The Railway Enigma,
                another D clone wich was used by the German
                Reichsbahn in Eastern Europe, was partially
                broken from 1941 onwards.</font></p>

        commercial Enigma was purchased by the German Navy and
        adapted for military use. They called it Funkschlüssel
        C. Meanwhile, Chiffriermaschinen-AG developed a special
        Enigma with rotors that have the same contact alignment
        as the D rotors, but with teeth, multiple notches and are
        advanced by cog wheels instead of pawls and ratchets (see
        patent drawing left). It also had a rotating reflector
        and a counter on its left. Only one is know to exist
        today. This probably experimental model, presented in
        1928 but exceptionally only patented in 1931, lead to the
        Enigma G. The Enigma G had different rotors with a zigzag
        pin placement and the counter on its right. Its rotors,
        which also had multiple notches, were moved by a system
        of gears, similar to the 1928 special predecessor.
        Already in 1928, the German Abwehr (Secret Service)
        bought the 12 Kg light Enigma G, also called Zahlwerk
        (clock-work) Enigma due to it's counter on the front
        panel. The Enigma G was exclusively used by the Abwehr.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1932, the Wehrmacht revised the
        commercial Enigma D and added the plugboard at the front
        of the machine. This version, the Enigma I, became known
        as the Wehrmacht Enigma and was introduced on a large
        scale in the Heer (Army) and public authorities. The
        Luftwaffe (Air Force) followed the Heer's lead in 1935.
        The Wehrmacht Enigma came initially with three rotors.
        From 1939 on they were equipped with five rotors.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1934, the German Navy adopted the
        Wehrmacht model, with its securer plugboard, and extended
        the set of rotors to eight. The Navy machine was called
        Funkschlüssel M or M3. In 1941, although reassured by
        the Abwehr that the Enigma M3 was unbreakable, Admiral
        Karl Dönitz insisted on improvement of the Kriegsmarine
        Enigma. Early in 1942, the famous four rotor M4 model was
        introduced in the Kriegsmarine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">During the war, different types of
        reflectors were introduced. The B and C reflector were
        used on Heer and Luftwaffe models, and also on the
        Kriegsmarine M3. The Kriegsmarine M4 used a thin B and C
        version, to fit in the 4 rotor machine, with other
        wirings, but if 'zeroized' in combination with its fourth
        rotor compatible with the Heer and Luftwaffe version. By
        the End of the war German Command tried to introduce a
        new type D rewirable reflector. Early use of this
        reflector posed a significant problem to Allied
        codebreakers, but problems in distribution of this
        reflector and their key sheets prevented a widespread use
        of the D reflector. Another military add-on, introducend
        in 1944 by the Luftwaffe, was an extra plugboard switch,
        called the Uhr (clock), a switch with 40 positions, each
        position resulting in a different combination of plug
        wiring. For more information about Enigma code books and

        <p><font size="2">An estimated total of 100,000 Enigma
        machines were produced.</font> <font size="2">Although
        generally know as Enigma, there were only a few machines
        that actually carried the name Enigma and the logo. Most
        machines only had a serial number and fabrication code.
        The machines were produced in different factories on
        various locations such as Ertel-Werk für Feinmechanik in
        München, Olympia Büromaschinenwerke in Erfurt,
        Chiffriermaschinengesellschaft Heimsoeth &amp; Rinke in
        Berlin, Atlas-Werke Maschinenfabrik in Bremen and Konski
        &amp; Krüger in Berlin. The machines that survived the
        war were confiscated by the Allies and mostly sold to
        other countries. The rotors of these machines were often
        rewired. Of course, they forgot to mention that they were
        able to break them.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2">When the Wehrmacht introduced
                the plugboard on the military Enigma, this added
                an astronomical number of possible key stettings.
                The general idea was that this military Enigma,
                unlike the commercial types, would be impossible
                to break. No one even tried to break it. However,
                in 1932, Poland's Biuro Szyfrow (Cipher Bureau)
                initiated attempts to analyse and break the
                Enigma messages. Although the chief of this
                Bureau received copies of codebooks sold by the
                German spy Hans-Thilo Schmidt, he did not give
                them to his codebreakers. He thought that keeping
                this information from them might stimulate their
                efforts.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Marian Rejewski, Henryk
                Zygalski and Jerzy Rozicki were convinced that
                mathematics could solve the problem and succeeded
                in breaking the Enigma messages. They also
                developed an electro-mechanical machine, called
                the Bomba, to speed up the codebreaking process.
                Two major security flaws in the German Enigma
                procedures were the global groundsetting and the
                twice encodes message-key, a procedure to exclude
                errors. These flaws opened the door to
                cryptanalysis. In 1939 the Bureau was no longer
                able to break the codes due to increased
                sophistication in the design, new procedures and
                lack of funds for the code breakers. When Germany
                invaded Poland, the Polish Biuro Szyfrow passed
                its secret knowledge and several replica Enigma
                machines to the baffled French and British
                intelligence. The work of the Biuro Szyfrow was
                vital, not only because their pioneering work
                itself, but also because it convinced other
                cipher bureaus that it was possible to break
                Enigma.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2">The Government Code and Cipher
                School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park initially
                broke Enigma by hand. In August 1940 they started
                using their own Bombes, designed by Alan Turing
                and Gordon Welchman. It was also a rotary
                electro-mechanical device but it worked on an
                entirely different principle as Jerewski's Bomba.
                The Turing Bombe searched for the enigma settings
                for a given piece of plain and cipher text. When
                an Enigma message was intercepted, codebreakers
                had to search for so-called cribs. These cribs
                were presumed pieces of plain text within the
                encrypted message. This could be &quot;An Der
                Oberbefehlshaber&quot;, &quot;An Gruppe&quot;,
                &quot;Es Lebe Den Fuhrer&quot; or any other
                standardized code (from code books) or piece of
                text.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Once a crib was located
                (special techniques existed to do this) the
                associations between the letters of the
                ciphertext and their plain version were entered
                in the Bombe. The Bombe, which contains a large
                number of drums, each replicating the rotors of
                the Enigma, ran through all possible settings to
                find the key settings that belong to the given
                pieces of cipher and plain text. Once these
                settings were found all messages, encrypted with
                these setting, could be deciphered.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">All information retrieved by
                cryptanalysis, the breaking of codes, had the
                codename &#147;Ultra&#148; and played a very
                important and often decisive role during the war,
                mainly in the Battle of the Atlantic. All Ultra
                information was used very carefully, so as to
                avoid suspicion among the German forces. Special
                liaison officers, trained to deal with this
                valuable but delicate knowledge, were placed in
                Headquarters and other strategic places.
                Moreover, Ultra was never used unless it could be
                confirmed by a second source in order to avoid
                giving the German Command reason to suspect that
                their communications security might be broken.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2">The German Kriegsmarine was
                very successful in applying their Rudeltaktik or
                &quot;Wolfpack Tactics&quot; with U-boats. They
                hunted individually for convoys. If a convoy was
                spotted, they shadowed it and called other
                U-boats into battle. Once all U-boats were on the
                spot, they sank the convoy with a closely
                co-ordinated attack. This technique was so
                devastating to the allied supplies that it almost
                decided the outcome of the war. Communication was
                the keyword and the U-boats used Enigma to send
                messages to co-ordinate their attacks. After some
                initial hard times, Bletchley Park broke the
                naval codes almost continuously.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Decreasing effectiveness of his
                U-boats made Admiral Donitz suspicious and,
                although reassured by German intelligence that
                Enigma was secure, he insisted on improving the
                Enigma's security. Early in 1942 the famous
                4-wheel machine was introduced in the Kriegmarine
                and the complicated 'Shark' codes caused a big
                crisis at Bletchley Park. The Kriegmarine
                referred to the spring of 1942 as the &quot;Happy
                Times&quot; because the Allied forces were unable
                to decipher the codes and the U-boats were able
                to continue sinking ships without much
                interference. More information is found on </font><a

                <p><font size="2">The codebreakers in Blechtley
                Park discovered by cryptanalysis that a fourth
                rotor had entered the battlefield of codes. After
                ten nerve-wracking months of heavy losses,
                Bletchley Park succeeded in breaking the 'Shark'
                codes. The major reason for this success was the
                capture of Kurzsignal codebooks by British Navy
                on German weather ships and the attacks on
                U-boats like Kapitanleutenant Heidtmann&#146;s
                U-559 by HMS Petard. These boarding were not to
                steal Enigma machines or key sheets, as often
                wrongly portrayed in movies and books (they
                already had replicas of the Enigma from the Biuro
                Szyfrow). Enigma key sheets only gave access to a
                particular radio net and area for a single month.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">However, only two editions of
                the Kurzsignal codebook, issued to all U-boats,
                were ever printed during the war. These codebooks
                encoded weather and operational reports in
                four-letter codes, prior to encryption with
                Enigma. By seizing them, Bletchley Park could use
                these four-letter codes as new cribs to attack
                all future Enigma setting. Moreover, new Bombes
                were developed to deal with the four-rotor
                Enigma, and by the end of 1943, another fifty of
                these Bombes became operational in the US Navy.

                <p><font size="2">The tide of the U-boat war had
                turned. Except for some brief periods, the entire
                communication system was intercepted by a large
                number of listening stations, and the message
                were broken in Bletchley Park, which employed
                over 7000 workers at its peak. With the positions
                of the U-boats unveiled, Allied ships could now
                evade the U-boats and the Allies actively hunted
                for U-boats. The elite weapon of the Kriegsmarine
                got decimated, with heavy losses among the U-boat
                crews. An estimated 700 U-boats and 30,000
                crewmen were lost at sea. U-boat command never
                suspected cryptanalysis of the Enigma and related
                these losses to new Allied submarine detection
                techniques like ASDIC sonar, surface radar, HF
                direction finding and anti-submarine airplanes.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">All improvements, introduced by
                the German Forces, were tackled successfully by
                the codebreakers. The introduction of the
                rewireable D reflector, with its key changes
                every ten days, proved to be a big problem to the
                codebreakers. A widespread use of the D reflector
                would require five to ten days to break a
                particular key, which would render tactical
                information useless. Without the D reflector,
                keys were broken mostly within 24 hours.
                Fortunately, logistical problems prevented
                general use of the D reflector in the German
                forces. Also, German operators were reluctant to
                use the D reflector and found it too elaborate to
                program in tactical situations. Instead, the B
                reflector remained the default reflector and the
                D reflector was used only for important messages,
                on the same machines with the same basic machine
                settings for rotors and plugboard. However, with
                the key already broken for these machines with
                the B reflector, the codebreaker only had to
                retrieve the unknown wiring of the D reflector,
                used on the same machines. A work that was
                performed by hand.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The fatal mixed use of B and D
                reflectors enabled the codebreakers to continue
                reading the once feared D reflector messages. The
                Enigma Uhr (clock), used by the Luftwaffe, was
                another useless effort by the Germans to increase
                the security of the Enigma. The Uhr was a switch
                that replaced the plugs of the Enigma and
                provided 40 different plug wirings. However, the
                unique design of the Allied Bombes, used to
                retrieve the key settings of the Enigma, excluded
                the plugboard wiring. The Enigma Uhr therefore
                had little or no effect on the codebreaking
                results.</font></p>

        was kept highly secret during the entire war and played a
        decisive role. Breaking the Heer and Luftwaffe messages
        also provided crucial tactical information. The
        codebreakers exposed the weakness of Field Marshal
        Rommel's notorious Afrika Korps. The speed and success of
        the Afrika Korps created long stretches of poorly
        defended supply lines. ULTRA information revealed their
        logistical problems and provided Field Marshal Montgomery
        with a vital tactical advantage. In the days before the
        D-day invasion of Normandy, the Wehrmacht, without
        realizing it, provided the Allies with an enormous
        quantity of detailed information on the coastal defences,
        location and strength of all German tank divisions and
        the movement of troops in France. Experts estimate that
        the breaking of Enigma shortened the war by about three
        years. The number of saved lives is innumerable. The
        large scale breaking of German communications was one of
        the best kept secret of the Second World War. German

        <p><font size="2">How secure was the Enigma machine
        actually and why ended it up being the Achilles heel of
        the superior German war machine? During a top secret
        Allied operation in the final days of the war, special
        TICOM teams round up German cryptologists and Signals
        Intelligence personnel. The answer to our question is
        found in their only recently declassified TICOM reports,
        vol 2, &#147;Notes on German High Level Cryptography and
        Cryptanalysis&#148; (</font><a
        href="http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/european_axis_sigint/volume_2_notes_on_german.pdf"
        target="_blank"><font size="2">see this link NSA website</font></a><font
        size="2">).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Summarized, it comes to this: to create
        a secure crypto device you need both excellent codemakers
        and codebreaker. You cannot effectively assess the
        security of a crypto machine unless you test it by trying
        to break it. According to TICOM, Germany had very capable
        cryptologists and developed some excellent crypto
        machines. Unfortunately, their codebreaking skills,
        although excellent, were not on par with their brilliant
        Polish, British and American counterparts.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It was this little difference in
        codebreaking skills that convinced the Germans that
        Enigma was secure. Their studies only revealed
        theoretical weaknesses. It was the same little difference
        in skills that enabled the Allies to find a practical
        solution to the theoretical weaknesses of the Enigma
        machine. German cryptologists did continue to develop
        various improvements to Enigma and other crypto machines
        during the war, some of which, according to TICOM
        reports, would prove impossible to break by the Allies at
        that time. Fortunately, as the war progressed, logistical
        problems, shortage of raw materials and lack of time and
        money kept these new machines from entering service.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">The heritage of Enigma </font><a
        href="enigma.htm#top"><font size="2"><img src="../pics/up1.gif"
        alt="Top" border="0" width="12" height="9"></font></a></h4>
        <p><font size="2">After the Second World War, Enigma was
        the basis for many more sophisticated rotor cipher
        machines like the Swiss NEMA, the American KL-7 ADONIS
        and the until recently top secret Russian M-125 FIALKA.
        Although Enigma was very well designed and offered, for
        those days, an unbreakable security, the negligent use in
        the German Armed Forces and the compromised codebook
        material enabled the codebreakers to turn the best kept
        secret of the war into a Trojan horse and give the
        kick-off for cryptographic intelligence. Today, Signal
        Intelligence is considered to be a most vital part of the
        modern battle.</font></p>

        an exact simulation of the 3-rotor Wehrmacht and
        Luftwaffe Enigma, the 3-rotor Kriegsmarine M3, also
        called Funkschlussel M, and the famous 4-rotor
        Kriegmarine M4 Enigma cipher machine, used during World
        War II from 1939 until 1945. You can select between the
        three models, actually choose different rotors or
        'Walzen', preset the rotor wiring positions or
        'Ringstellung' and switch letters by using plugs or
        'Stecker'. The internal wiring of all rotors is identical
        to those used by the Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and
        Kriegsmarine. This simulator is therefore fully
        compatible with the real Enigma-machine and you can
        decode original messages and make your own encoded text.
        Runs under Windows.</font></p>
