        The German Rasterschlüssel 44</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/rs44small.jpg"
        align="right" hspace="0" width="361" height="475"></font><font
        size="2">The Rasterschlüssel 44 (RS 44) was an excellent
        German hand cipher for encryption of low-level military
        traffic during the Second World War. Introduced in March
        1944, RS 44 was a perfect mix of security and ease of
        use. It took Allied codebreakers so much time to break
        the messages that the content was no longer of tactical
        use to them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On this page we will explain how the
        cipher was used, as prescribed by the &quot;<em>Schlusselanleitung
        zum Rasterschlüssel 44, 24 Marz 1944, Oberkommando der
        Wehrmacht&quot;</em>, give a practical example and trace
        its origins. An Excel sheet to generate and print RS 44
        keys is also available for download.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Rasterschlüssel 44 Composition</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The Rasterschlüssel 44 (see image
        right) is a grid based transposition cipher that shuffles
        the plaintext letters. To encipher, plaintext is written
        in the rows and ciphertext taken from the columns. To
        decipher, ciphertext is written in the columns and
        plaintext is taken from the rows.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The RS 44 grid (<em>Rasterschablone</em>)
        has 600 cells (24 rows and 25 columns). Each row contains
        10 irregularly placed white (empty) cells to hold the
        message text and 15 black cells. The columns and rows
        have unique randomly ordered digraphs (two-letter codes),
        each composed with two from the letters a, b, c, d and e,
        and ranging from &quot;aa&quot; to &quot;ee&quot;. The
        columns also carries the randomly ordered numbers 1
        through 25. In addition, the Rasterschlüssel has two
        scrambled place name alphabets (<em>Ortsnamenalphabete</em>)
        to encode place names and a scrambled letter conversion
        table (<em>Buchstabentauschtafel</em>) to encode
        digraphs. The selection of the place names alphabet was
        prescribed by special order. The white and black cells,
        the grid digraphs and numbering, the two alphabets and
        the conversion table changed each day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Rasterschlüssel template was
        placed and aligned underneath the first sheet of the
        message pad. The pad sheets were very thin, slightly
        transparent and contained grid lines. This way, the
        operator could see the template but wrote on the message
        sheet.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Composing the Message</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The message must be at least 60 letters
        long and should never exceed 200 letters (always leaving
        at least 40 cells unused). Random words (<em>Wahlworter</em>),
        not related to the message, must be added when the
        message contains less than 60 letters. To distinguish the
        random words from the actual message, the random word
        just before and/or just after the message has its last
        two resp. first two letters written twice (e.g.
        &quot;dunkeell&quot; &amp; message &amp;
        &quot;rriichtung&quot;). Messages with more than 200
        letters should be divided into several smaller messages.
        Each message part should be enciphered independently.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Place names must be encoded with the
        place names alphabet. Place names should never be
        repeated, unless confusion or errors could occur.
        Repetitions must not be separated by an &quot;x&quot;.
        The letters &quot;aa&quot; and &quot;ee&quot; are used
        resp. before and after the encoded place names, to
        distinguish them from the rest of the message.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The operators were encouraged to use
        unambiguous abbreviations as much as possible, even when
        this results in a message of less than 60 letters (in
        that case, the message is extended with random words). In
        general, punctuations are never used unless they are
        required to create a unambiguous text. If used, they are
        spelled out. A period is written as &quot;stop&quot;, a
        comma as &quot;koma&quot;, a question mark by
        &quot;fraq&quot; and quotes by &quot;klam&quot;. Spaces
        are never used and a separation by an &quot;x&quot; was
        allowed only in ambiguous situations.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The German Umlaute are written out (ä
        = ae, ë = ae, ö = oe, ü = ue), the letter combinations
        &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;ck&quot; are replaced by
        &quot;q&quot; and &quot;ß&quot; by &quot;sz&quot;.
        Numbers were spelled out, digit by digit. Multiple zeros
        were spelled: 00 = zenta, 000 = mille, 0000 = mira (e.g.
        5200 becomes funf zwei zenta). Roman numbers are preceded
        by &quot;roman&quot;.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Enciphering with RS 44</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">A random column and row are selected
        and are designated by the digraphs of the colums and row.
        The start cell (the first letter of the plaintext) is
        located at the crossing of the chosen column and row or,
        if that cell is black, at the next-right white (empty)
        cell. The start cells for successive messages should be
        chosen all across the grid. If a row or column is used
        once, its digraph is marked with one stroke. If it is
        used again, the digraph is marked with a second stroke
        (cross). Digraphs with a cross should never be reused
        when there are still digraphs without a cross or a single
        stroke available.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To encipher, the plaintext is entered
        from left to right in the empty cells. When reaching the
        end of the grid, the plaintext continues at the next
        empty cell in the top left corner of the grid. The
        ciphertext is taken by columns, from top cell to bottom
        cell, in the order as given by the numbers in the column.
        The ciphertext is written out in groups of five letters.
        However, the start column to take the ciphertext is
        predetermined.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Initially, the start column was
        determined by the message time and letter count. First,
        the total of the digits from the minutes in the message
        time and the digits of the letter count is calculated. An
        example: time 1725 and 83 letters gives 2 + 5 + 8 + 3 =
        18. Next, we count 18 columns to the right, starting from
        the column, right-next to the column that was selected to
        determine the first cell (if we arrive at the far right
        of the grid, we continue counting at the left of the
        grid). If we arrive at the 18th column and it carries ,
        for instance, the number 12, we take the ciphertext in
        the columns that carries the number 12, 13, 14 and so on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In October 1944, the Supreme Command of
        the Wehrmacht issued an order to drop this system and use
        a new and easier procedure to determine the start column.
        From then on, the start column was selected directly and
        randomly by the operator. In this procedure, columns
        should vary for each new message and the first column
        should never be used. </font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">The Message Key</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The four letters of the column digraph
        and row digraph (start cell position) are encoded with
        the letter conversion table. The letters (a, b, c, d or
        e) are replaced with a randomly chosen letter beneath it
        in the conversion table. The use of chosen letters should
        vary and all four digraph letters should be different.
        The encoded digraphs are the so-called message key (<em>Spruchschlüssel</em>).
        The complete message header, including the message key,
        could look like:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">1725 - 83 dacb -</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">From October 1944 onwards, with the
        change of start column procedure, the digraph that
        represented the start column was encoded with the letter
        conversion table, in the same way as the start cell
        digraphs are encoded. Now, the message header, including
        the encoded start column digraph, would look like:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">1725 - 83 - dacb ed
        -</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Some RS 44 keys had key identification
        groups (<em>Kenngruppen</em>). If provided, there were
        four three-letter identification groups for each day and
        type of key. These identification groups were normally
        only used when identification is required. The four key
        identification groups were used alternately and inserted
        in the message header. If , for example, the
        identification group was &quot;xeh&quot;, the message
        header would look like:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">1725 - 83 - xeh dach
        ed -</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Deciphering with RS 44</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The receiving operator retrieves the
        message key by decoding it with the letter conversion
        table. He looks which letter (a, b, c, d, or e) is placed
        above the encoded digraph letter in the conversion table.
        With the decoded column and row digraphs, he can
        determine the start cell. The start column is either
        calculated from the message time and letter count (old
        procedure) or by decoding the start column digraph in the
        message key (new procedure).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">He counts the empty cells, starting in
        the start cell, row by row, in the same ways as you would
        write a plaintext message. The unused cells beneath
        and/or above the message cells and before or after the
        message cells should be crossed out with a horizontal
        line, making visible the area that is reserved for the
        message text. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">He can now fill the ciphertext into the
        reserved cells, column by column, beginning with the
        start column and continues with the columns as determined
        by the column header numbers. The ciphertext is entered
        per column from top to bottom, but only in the cells that
        are reserved for the message text. When the complete
        message text area is filled with ciphertext, the operator
        can read the plaintext, row by row, beginning at the
        start cell.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">A Practical Example</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The following message is sent at 1400

        <p><font size="2">A random start cell is selected. In our
        example key sheet below, we select column &quot;ce&quot;
        and row &quot;bb&quot; and mark these digraphs. The
        digraphs are also noted on the key sheet. Since this
        position is a black cell, we take the next empty cell,
        which is five cells further to the right. We start
        filling in the message and continue at the top of the
        grid to enter all 133 letters.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The message key is the column digraph
        and the row digraph, encoded with a randomly chosen
        letter in the letter conversion table. We encode
        &quot;cebb&quot; into &quot;mvxe&quot;, but we could just
        as well encode it into &quot;atne&quot; or into
        &quot;sibh&quot;. This clever method makes it very
        difficult for the codebreakers to identify messages that
        are enciphered with the same message keys</font></p>
        <p><img src="../pics/rs44conversion.jpg" width="110"
        height="138"></p>
        <p><font size="2">Next, the column to start taking the
        ciphertext is determined. Since the message is sent
        before October 1944, we use the old procedure. The
        message time is 1400 and the message contains 133
        letters. Thus, 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7. We start counting
        from the cell next right of column &quot;ce&quot;, as
        selected above. Thus, the column to start taking the the
        ciphertext by columns is &quot;ee&quot;, with its value
        15. We indicate this column by writing a cross in one of
        its empty cells. After taking the letters from column 15,
        we take columns 16, 17, 18 and so on. (note that in new
        start column procedure the column would have been
        selected randomly and its digraph also converted with the
        letter conversion table from above and placed after the
        message key).</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">This gives a overall theoretical total
        of 7,95 x 10<sup>280</sup> different ways to construct a
        RS 44 key sheet, comparable with a 934 bit key. This,
        however, is a theoretical number. In reality, there are
        far less combinations, because a codebreaker won't not
        care about how the columns and rows are labelled, or how
        the message key is converted. He just needs to know how
        the letters are actually placed in the 600 cells and how
        they are taken from the columns. He takes in account the
        following properties:</font></p>
        <ul>
            <li><font size="2">2.21 x 10<sup>156</sup> ways to
                fill the 24 rows (3,268,760 ways to place 10
                white cells in a single row)</font></li>
            <li><font size="2">240 different positions to start
                filling the cells with text (24 rows with 10
                white cells each)</font></li>
            <li><font size="2">25 column start positions to begin
                taking the ciphertext</font></li>
            <li><font size="2">15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000
                ways to order the reading of the columns</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2">The variables above give a total key
        size of 2.06 x 10<sup>185</sup>. Unfortunately, the
        Germans failed to apply this key space on RS-44. They
        only produced 36 different rods to print the rows. Also,
        the actual messages were mostly never longer than 60
        letters, limiting the numers of rows that were used. With
        all possible permutations for the transposition key and
        start positions there's only a practical key space of 2 x
        10<sup>35</sup>, comparible with a 117 bit key. The
        conversion alphabet for place names is a simple
        substitution and, although it has
        15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000 possible combinations,
        can be solved with simple letter frequency analysis.
        This, of course, is only possible if the rest of message
        is already broken successfully and the grid and column
        order is restored correctly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">A practical key size of 117 bits is
        huge number, impossible to break by brute force (trying
        out all combinations) with all present computational
        power. However, codebreaking is more than trying out all
        possible keys. In such transposition ciphers, the
        positions of the letters always follow certain rules. For
        instance, two consecutive ciphertext letters have a fair
        chance to have been taken in the same column and it will
        therefore be unlikely that they are placed next to each
        other in the plaintext. The fixed number of 10 white
        cells per row also enables to draw some conclusions on
        the distance of plaintext letters in the ciphertext and
        how they transpose. Any rule or assumption is a clue for
        the codebreaker.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Nevertheless, RS 44 creates a most
        complex disrupted double transposition: the black cells
        create a horizontal disrupted fractioning of the message
        text which is followed by a wide column transposition.
        The size of the column text segments varies very
        irregularly, as you have seen in the message example
        above. Note that the normal double transposition was one
        of the strongest hand ciphers during the Second World War
        and it's cryptanalysis was released only a few years ago.
        Until today, no ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of the RS
        44 had been published, if it already exists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In general, transposition ciphers are
        solvable by multiple anagramming when several messages
        with exactly the same transposition are available. With
        this method, assumptions or clues on the transpositions
        of letters on one message are tested and verified against
        as many as possible other messages. For RS 44, the
        transposition variables for a particular key are the
        start cell and the start column, the so-called message
        key. There are 6000 possible different message keys (240
        start cells x 25 start columns). A first obstacle for any
        codebreakers is that the message keys are encoded in a
        random fashion, making it much harder to find messages
        that are enciphered with the same transposition.
        Secondly, it could take several thousands of messages
        before a particular message key is reused, if the
        selection of varying message keys is well applied. If
        compartimentation of keys is applied on radio nets, and a
        message load of less than 6000 messages for a particular
        key is anticipated, there is little change that the
        codebreaker has any messages with identical transposition
        at his disposal, making it much more difficult to break
        the messages.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">RS 44 proved to be a very secure hand
        cipher, especially if the number of messages per key was
        limited. British codebreakers had only limited success
        and it required a huge 40-letter crib (known plaintext)
        and about two weeks to make an initial break into the
        traffic of a given grid. They had a far better success
        rate with the (by the Germans) highly regarded Enigma
        machine than with RS 44 (it should be noted that the
        breaking of high-level Enigma traffic was more valuable
        and therefore received more resources). The low level RS
        44 traffic was generally local tactical information. The
        time, required to break RS 44 messages, rendered its
        tactical information outdate before it could be
        exploited, making RS 44 an ideal hand cipher. Eventually,
        the codebreakers gave up trying to break the Wehrmacht RS
        44 messages and limited their efforts to German police RS
        44 enciphered message traffic only. They even considered
        RS44 as impossible to break if the Germans had not made
        implementation mistakes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The German Army however was very
        reluctant to introduce RS-44. TICOM reports on the
        interrogation of German cryptologic personnel at the end
        of the war showed that the German Army often put up
        fierce resistance against the implementation of new
        enciphering systems and procedures. The cipher clercks
        often disliked new cipher systems and resented the
        efforts, required to get familiar with them. RS-44 what
        not an exception. Although straightforward and simple
        from a cryptologists point of view, the cipher clercks
        found it to be too complex for use at the battle front
        and continiously made mistakes that jeopardized the
        cipher's security.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Although already an excellent hand
        cipher, there was still room for improvement that hardly
        increased the cipher clerk's work load. A variable number
        of white cells per row would have increased the
        combinations considerably. 10 white cell per row give
        3,268,760 combinations per row, whereas 9 cells provide
        2,042,975 combinations and 11 cells 4,457,400
        combinations. A variable 9 to 11 white cells would
        provide 9,769,135 combinations for a single row (with
        more than 13 cells, the number of combinations decreases
        again and transposition quality declines). Also, the use
        of each of the four sides and front and back of the grid
        template (as proposed for the Cysquare) would further
        increase the key size by a factor of 8. Assigning 3
        digraphs to each of the 8 template positions would enable
        the use of a fourth (randomly) encoded message key
        digraph. The selection of the alphabet for place names
        could be determined more randomly by using the first
        letter of the plaintext, taking the alphabet where that
        letter appears as first. After successful decryption of
        the overall message, the receiving operator would find
        that plaintext letter and select the correct alphabet for
        his place names. Even taking some of the columns from
        bottom to top instead of top to bottom is feasible.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">But even without these improvements,
        the Rasterschlüssel 44 can be considered as one of the
        best hand ciphers ever to combine a good level of
        security with a practical use.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Origins of the Rasterschlüssel</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The origins of RS 44 are surprisingly
        found on British soil. In 1941, Brigadier John H.
        Tiltman, a Britsh officer and brilliant codebreaker at
        the Government Communications &amp; Cypher School
        (GC&amp;CS), proposed his new manual cipher Cysuare to
        replace the insecure Army Stencil Cipher.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Cysquare has a grid with 676 (26 x
        26) cells. Each row has 10 empty cells for the message
        text and 16 black cells. However, three rows contained 20
        empty cells and three other rows contained only black
        cells. The daily key consisted of a randomly shuffled
        alphabet and the numbers from 1 to 26 written underneath
        them, also in random order. Both random alphabet and
        numbers are written from left to right at the top of the
        grid and from bottom to top on the left side of the grid.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The square comes with a list of
        four-letter indicator groups. Each letter corresponds to
        the number, found underneath that particular letter in
        the random alphabet. The first numbers represent the
        position of the grid, which can be used with each of its
        four sides at the top. The second and third numbers
        represent the row and column, of which the coordinate
        line shows the starting cell.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The message text is written from left
        to right in the empty cells, starting from the next empty
        cell after the starting cell. If the text reaches the end
        of the grid, the text is continued from the top left cell
        of the grid. Finally, the forth number of the indicator
        represents the initial read-off column. The final
        ciphertext is taken, column by column, from top to
        bottom, in the order of the numbers at the top of the
        grid, starting and from the initial read-off column. The
        final message text consists of the indicator, followed by
        the ciphertext, the number of letters, the indicator
        repeated, the time and the date.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The system was designed to be used in
        two versions: the &quot;stencil&quot; card with punched
        holes to write into the empty fields on a sheet
        underneath the card. This version even allowed the use of
        both sides of the grid card, giving eight instead of four
        grid positions. The pad version was a booklet with 50
        identical grids. Despite being both a very secure and
        practical hand cipher, its implementation proved to be a
        complete flop. Unfortunately, the instructions encouraged
        the operators to rub out the message and reuse the same
        sheet as many times as possible. The Cysquare entered the
        battlefield in the British Eight Army, operating in North
        Africa. The cipher clerks refused to use the Cysquare
        shortly after its introduction because the desert weather
        and the gum soon turned the white cells on the grid
        indistinguishable from the black cells.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Cysquare began an unexpected new
        career when fieldmarchall Rommel's Afrika Korps overran
        British units and captured the Cysquare pads with their
        instructions. German cryptologists recognized it as an
        excellent hand cipher and decided to develop their own
        version of the Cysquare. The modified cipher, designated
        Rasterschlüssel 44 or RS 44, was introduced in March
        1944. Later, Brigadier Tiltman, the developer of
        Cysquare, noted ruefully that the Allies had considerable
        trouble in breaking RS44 enciphered messages.</font></p>
