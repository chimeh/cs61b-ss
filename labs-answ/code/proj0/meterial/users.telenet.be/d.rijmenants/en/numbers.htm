                the Air</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">Numbers stations are mysterious
                shortwave radio stations, broadcasting streams of
                numbers or letters using the phonetic alphabet,
                by voice, Morse or digital tones. The messages
                are usually groups of four or five numbers or
                letters and are typically repeated by reading
                each group twice or repeating the entire message.
                These stations are unlicensed high power HF
                transmitters, broadcasting worldwide in various
                formats and languages.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">They do this day and night on a
                wide range of frequencies and it's been going on
                for decades, yet no single private, commercial or
                government agency ever stepped forward to
                officially confirm that they are responsible for
                these strange broadcasts. However, today there is
                enough evidence that these stations are used by
                Intelligence agencies to send encrypted messages
                and operational instructions to their agents in
                covert operations abroad.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The messages are broadcast on
                very powerful shortwave transmitters with
                frequencies ranging from 3,000 to 30,000 KHz. The
                numbers or letters are spoken in many different
                languages, usually a female voice, but sometimes
                male or those of children. Many of the broadcasts
                are mysterious mechanically or electronically
                generated voices. The stations often use
                introduction signals as a beacon, prior to a
                actual message. These repeating phrases,
                electronic sounds or music enable the receiver to
                adjust his radio to the desired frequency. In
                recent years, many numbers stations switched from
                voice or Morse to digital tones. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Radio amateurs monitor these
                broadcasts and they sometimes give nicknames to a
                station, according to its typical introduction
                phrase (e.g. the Cuban &quot;Atencion&quot;
                station), prelude music (Swedish rhapsody) or
                language of the voice (Bulgarian Betty). Some
                stations are called counting stations, because of
                their introduction signal. An example is the
                Cuban &quot;Atencion 1234567890&quot;.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The Cold War era, from the
                1950s until the end of the 1980s, is known for
                its numerous and very active numbers stations,
                not by coincidence the heydays of espionage. Many
                of the broadcasts came from the Eastern-block
                countries, China and Cuba, but also from several
                Western countries.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">After the 1989 fall of the
                Berlin Wall, the number of stations significantly
                decreased from countries like East and
                West-Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary or Bulgaria.
                The voices of those stations were mostly Russian
                or German. However, several decades after the end
                of the Cold War, stations remain active in the
                former Soviet-Union, Europe, and in North and
                South America, and new stations continue to
                appear all over the world. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Most numbers stations use a
                basic format to send the streams of numbers or
                letters. Some stations broadcast every day at a
                fixed hour, and disappear after a few days or
                weeks. Other stations have an irregular time
                schedules and appear and disappear over time. One
                of the most regular numbers stations ever was the
                Lincolnshire Poacher (E3 Voice), named after the
                English folk song that was used as its interval
                signal. After transmitting the very recognizable
                melody and a call-sign for about ten minutes, the
                message was sent by an electronic
                English-accented female voice in groups of five
                figures. The station aired every day from the
                1970s until 2008. A simple small shortwave radio
                was sufficient to capture the Lincolnshire
                Poacher. It is believed that the station
                broadcast from the RAF Akrotiri basis in Cyprus
                and that is was operated by the British Secret
                Intelligence Service. Unfortunately, the world of
                radio waves lost a true Cold War icon when the
                station went off-air in 2008. Its Asian sister
                station Cherry Ripe however is still active.</font></p>
                <h4><font size="2">Why Numbers Stations</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">Although no government or legal
                broadcaster ever acknowledged any involvement in
                these broadcasts, it is obvious that the costs
                and organization of such large-scale illegal
                broadcasts can only be supported and approved by
                government agencies. Countries like Russia, China
                and the United States exploit large shortwave
                antenna parks in their own country and at their
                embassies abroad.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The content and structure of
                the messages are identical to cryptographically
                encrypted messages. The groups appear to be
                totally random and without any logical order or
                meaning. It is assumed, and confirmed in several
                uncovered spy cases, that the seemingly random
                numbers or letters are actually one-time-pad
                encrypted messages. Numbers messages were used
                extensively in the Second World War. The British
                Special Operations Executive (SOE), the American
                Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and many other
                intelligence agencies used them to communicate
                with their espionage and sabotage teams,
                operating behind enemy lines.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">History has proven this to be a
                most secure method. One-time pads are sheets or
                booklets with keys that consist of series of
                truly random numbers or letters. Enciphering and
                deciphering a message only requires pencil and
                paper and some basic calculations. Each message
                is enciphered with a unique one-time pad which is
                destroyed after one-time use. If properly
                applied, one-time pad is the only system that is
                proven to be mathematically unbreakable. Visit my

                <p><font size="2">The one-way shortwave broadcast
                has many advantages for Intelligence agencies.
                Powerful shortwave transmitters reflect their
                signal many times between the earth's surface and
                the ionosphere, carrying them over very long
                distances. This enables Intelligence agencies to
                send messages to agents located in far away
                countries. The many reflections also make it
                difficult to accurately locate the transmitter
                and find out who is broadcasting. The enormous,
                almost global range of shortwave makes it
                impossible to identify the country of
                destination, let alone the person who receives
                the message.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Therefore, there is little risk
                of exposing the secret agent who receives a
                message. A simple commercial shortwave
                world-receiver can pick up a messages and the
                agent doesn't need a compromising special
                receiver or crypto equipment. He can easily carry
                and hide a large number of one-time pads in small
                booklets or on microfilm, and the manual one-time
                pad system, although slow and elaborate, requires
                nothing more than a pencil and paper. Therefore,
                numbers stations are an ideal method of covert
                one-way communication to illegal agents abroad.</font></p>
                <h4><font size="2">Evidence for use as Spy
                Stations</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">Over time, declassified
                documents from court trials and Intelligence
                agencies revealed the truth about these
                mysterious numbers stations. They also show that
                the era of spy stations and espionage is far from
                over. This information enables us to discard all
                stories about numbers stations being so-called
                weather buoys, shipping reports or other
                fairytales. Several spies have been caught in
                possession of shortwave radios and one time pads.
                Given the widespread and frequent use of numbers
                stations, the published cases are undoubtedly
                only the tip of the iceberg.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In 1962, Soviet GRU Colonel
                Oleg Penkovsky was arrested by the KGB and
                charged with espionage. During a search of his
                Moscow apartment, the KGB found one-time pads,
                instructions on how to receive and decipher
                encrypted radio messages, including a
                letter-to-digit checkerboard and a Morse cut
                numbers table, a Sony shortwave radio, a Minox
                camera and other spy equipment, cleverly hidden
                inside a secret compartment in his desk. See also

                Cold War to Cold Peace</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">Are numbers stations still
                useful in this age of global communications,
                Internet and satellite links? Yes! The so-called
                end of the Cold War did not bring a significant
                decrease in espionage activities. In the
                contrary, the Cold War is merely replaced by a
                Cold Peace where espionage is booming. In today's
                world, with the globalization of economics,
                politics and conflicts without borders, covert
                and illegal agents of Eastern, Western, Asian and
                Far East countries still operate extensively in
                each others countries to gather Intelligence and
                run operations. They still need a secure way to
                receive their operational instructions and
                messages. However, today, all modern
                communication systems are controlled by computers
                and are therefore by definition insecure.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Telephone, Internet and even
                satellite transmissions can be monitored. E-mails
                can be intercepted and read. Some government
                agencies have the money and resources to monitor
                communications and trace both sender and
                receiver. An example is the huge ECHELON project
                which globally intercepts and identifies all
                kinds of communications. In times of conflict,
                countries can simply block the Internet or other
                communications, or even simply switch off
                satellites. There have been successful tests to
                destroy satellites with missiles, making
                satellite communications unreliable during a
                serious conflict. Or did you really believe to
                continue using telephone or Internet between,
                let's say, Russia and the United States, if they
                where at war with each other?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Imagine a war broke out and
                intelligence personnel are operating behind enemy
                lines. The only secure and reliable way to
                communicate with them would be the good
                old-fashion long distance shortwave radio. But
                even in times of peace, some covert operations
                are so sensitive that discovering them would
                bring governments big problems or embarrassment.
                It is believed that some numbers stations
                continuously send fake messages, just to keep the
                lines open, ready for use. Those who monitor
                these stations are unable to notice when a
                station suddenly changes from sending random
                numbers to operational encrypted traffic. A good
                example is the Lincolnshire Poacher, sending
                messages of 200 groups, each and every day, for
                almost 40 years. Reasons enough why numbers
                stations are still active and useful. With their
                long and outstanding career of more than 70
                years, the numbers stations have become an icon
                of espionage.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">And still, every single day,
                numbers messages are transmitted all over the
                world, spoken in English, Russian, Spanish,
                Chinese and many other languages. Who's
                broadcasting them and, even more intriguing,
                who's listening to them...?</font></p>
