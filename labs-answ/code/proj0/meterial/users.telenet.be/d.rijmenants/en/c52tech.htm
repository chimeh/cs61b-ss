                the success of the Hagelin C-38 and the US M-209
                as tactical cipher devices Hagelin Cryptos
                (Crypto AG, Switzerland) decided to developed a
                cipher machine that could resist extensive
                cryptanalysis to open the door to the market of
                high level military and diplomatic encryption. In
                1952 the C-52 was introduced and, as Devours and
                Kruh wrote, &quot;caused ripples throughout the
                cryptanalytic community&quot;. The C-52 raised
                the security of pin-and-lug type devices to
                another level. Thanks to its brilliant design
                this all-mechanical machine has a tremendous
                keyspace and cryptographic strength. When the
                variable key elements are selected carefully the
                CX-52 provides even in this computer era a
                powerful encryption. Within a short time the C-52
                and CX-52 were purchased by more than 60
                countries and remained popular for decades. This
                makes the Hagelin C-52 and CX-52 the most
                successful Cold War era cipher machines. <br>

                <p><font size="2">The C-52 and CX-52 are
                all-mechanical pin-and-lug type cipher machines.
                Both plain and cipher text are printed on a
                gummed paper ribbon. The C-52 has 6 pinwheels,
                selected from a set of 12, with 25, 26, 29, 31,
                34, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 46 and 47 pins. The
                number of drum bars is extended to 32 (against 25
                for the C-38) of which 5 movement bars are used
                to advance the wheels. The wheels are labeled
                with both letters and numbers (e.g. A B 3 C D 6
                ...). Each wheel has another labeling sequence.
                The CX-52 model has 6 pinwheels with 47 pins each
                and a more flexible pinwheel advancing system
                with a higly irregular wheel movement. Both
                models were produced at the same time, with the
                C-52 producing a very long period and the CX-52 a
                very complex periode. However, Hagelin produced
                many variations on these machines. An example is
                the CX-52 shown here, with its iregular stepping
                combined with pinwheels with different sizes as
                used in the C-52. More about machine variations
                further on this page.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">The Cipher or Decipher mode is selected
        with a knob on the left side. To encipher the operator
        turns the large letter knob on the left side until the
        desired letter appears on the letter dial and pushes the
        lever on the right side of the machine downwards. In
        Cipher mode the letters are printed in groups of five
        letters and the letter X is used to replace a space. In
        Decipher mode there are no groups and a deciphered letter
        X is replaced by a space. When the counter is reset, this
        also will reset the group counting of the printing
        mechanism. The unit can be attached to a separate
        electrical motorised keyboard. The combination of C-52 or
        CX-52 and B-52 electrical keyboard is called BC-52.</font></p>

                wheel has one normal and one reciprocal alphabet.
                Encryption is performed by setting the normal
                alphabet wheel to a plain letter and then adding
                a number of steps. In the new position of the
                print wheel the cipher text is printed with the
                reciprocal print wheel. The pseudo random number
                of added steps is determined by the settings of
                the lugs on the drum and the pins on the wheels
                [1]. Thanks to the reciprocal alphabet the
                decryption process is identical to encryption
                process and the only difference is the printout

                one or more of the six positions on each of these
                bars. When the operator turns the handle or uses
                the keyboard the drum will make a complete
                revolution. In front of the drum there are 6
                pinwheels, all having a small pin for each
                position of the wheel. This pin can be positioned
                to the left or the right. Each wheel has a guide
                arm with a sloping end that will move towards the

        bars are forced to slide to the left [3]. The left side
        of the drum works as a variable-toothed gear [4]. Each
        bar that is slid to the left is one more tooth on the
        drum. The drum will turn the gear from the printing
        wheel. Therefore, the number of steps that are added to
        the plain letter is the number of teeth on the drum.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">The C-52 produces a constant stepping
        of the wheels, each with its own prime number of pins,
        resulting in a very long period of different wheel
        position combinations. On the CX model the movement of
        the 6 wheels depends on the settings of the lugs on the
        drum and the pins on the wheels, which results in a
        complex stepping. If we number the wheels from left to
        right the first wheel steps on each cycle of the drum.
        The other 5 wheels are moved by 5 special advance bars.
        Each of these bars is identical to the encryption bars
        but it also has small fixed pins. If a lug on such a bar
        contacts an active guide arm it will be forced to slide
        to the left, just as a normal bar. However, in the case
        of advance bars a little fixed pin at that bar will now
        be positioned right in front of a small gear wheel, which
        steps the pinwheel one step further. On the photo from
        the drum (above) we can see two small movement pins on
        the left side of bar number 5.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In the example below [5] we can see
        that the current pin on wheel 2 is in the active
        position, and on the drum the advance bar for wheel 5 has
        a lug in position 2. The moment the drum revolves, that
        lug will contact the guide arm from wheel 2, push the bar
        to the left and let the small fixed pin advance wheel 5.</font></p>

        wheels is done by opening the cover and pull out the main
        wheel axle to the right. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The experts recommend that a
        statistically random method be used in choosing a pattern
        for setting the pins. A simple way is flipping a coin and
        writing down the result (obverse = active pin, reverse =
        inactive pin). For an even distribution you should never
        allow more than 3 successive pins on any wheel to have
        the same state, and try to have close to 50 percent of
        the pins on a wheel in the active position.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">The lugs on the drum determine which
        bars will contact the guide arms of the wheels and force

        should be selected carefully.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To create a good lug setting we select
        6 numbers between 1 and 14 whose sum is 27. Assign each
        of these numbers to one of the 6 positions. Write down
        all 64 possible combinations of 6 pins for a given state
        of the drum. The easiest way to do so is to write them
        down in binary order (1 = 000001, 2 = 000010, 3 = 000011
        and so on). For each possible combination of pins, find
        the sum of numbers which have an active pin. Write this
        sum to the right of that combination. If a sum is greater
        than 25, subtract 26 from it. Continue until you have all
        sums for all possible pin combinations. Finally, check
        whether the 64 sums include all possible numbers from 0
        to 25. If this is not the case, discard the lugging set
        and make a new one. With a little experience you will be
        able to correct bad luggings by changing only a few lugs.
        If we follow all these rules there are 35,100 different

        <p><font size="2">The advance bars are responsible for
        the irregular movement of the wheels and are critical for
        the cryptographic security of the machine. If a bar is
        forced to the left by an active guide arm that contacts a
        lug, the wheel that is commanded by that bar will move.
        Bar 1 commands wheel 2, bar 2 commands wheel 3 and so on.
        Let us see what happens when the drum turns one complete
        cycle.We will use the example below to explain one good
        and one bad lug setting for the wheel movement. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The bars move one by one by one past
        the guide arms and bar 1 is the first bar to pass the
        guide arms. A lug is represented by the letter X. Notice
        that more than one lug can be placed on a single bar.
        Wheel 1 always moves, no matter what state the lugs or
        pins have. If there's an active pin on wheel 1 then all 5
        bars will be forced to the left since there is a lug in
        position 1 on each of the 5 bars. Therefore wheels 2, 3,
        4, 5 and 6 will advance one step. An active pin on wheel
        2 will move wheels 3, 4, 5 and 6. An active pin on wheel
        3 will move wheels 4, 5 and 6, and so on. This creates a
        highly irregular wheel movement sequence, depending on
        the state of the pins on the wheels.</font></p>

        only move if there is an active pin on wheel 1. Wheel 3
        only moves if there is an active pin on wheel 2 and so
        on. This results in a very slow rotation of the last
        wheels, limiting the pin variation and therefore
        weakening the security.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">The special wheel movement bars in the
        early CX-52 setup are also used for enciphering. When
        using the movement bars also for enciphering the lugs,
        one must follow the rules as explained above, but also be
        sure to create a good stepping cycle for the wheels.
        Therefore, due to complications in preparation of
        acceptable lug patterns, later CX-52 models use the
        special movement bars exclusively for the stepping of the
        pin wheels and no longer had a thoot at their left side
        to advance the print wheel. There are different versions
        of the C-52 and CX-52. Some have fixed advance bars
        spread all over the drum instead of the normal first 5
        bars. On some machine versions the advance bars are
        detachable and their order can be changed.</font></p>

        In the Variable mode, the position between left and right

        <p><font size="2">The start position of the six wheels at
        the beginning of the message is called the message key.
        This message key is a crucial part of the cryptographic
        settings of the machine and must be unique for each
        encrypted message, in order to make optimal use of the
        key variations. If the same message key is used for many
        different messages this increases the amount of
        statistical information for a cryptanalytic attack on the
        message. There was no standard procedure to encipher
        messages. Each customer could create his own message
        procedure, of course assisted by the advice of the
        manufacturer. One part of the procedure is telling the
        receiver which message key was used for the transmitted
        message.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">One way to relay the message key is to
        include it into the message. However, the operator must
        encipher the message key before transmission in order to
        relay it in a secure way. This can be done by selecting a
        random message key (which is used to encipher the
        message), set a random start position for the six wheels
        and then encipher the selected random message key. Next,
        the random start positions and the enciphered version of
        the message key are sent together with the message. The
        receiver sets his wheels in the received random start
        positions, deciphers the encrypted message key, sets the
        retrieved message key as start position and deciphers the
        rest of the message.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The procedure with the enciphered
        message key, as described above depends entirely on the
        secrecy of the machine settings. If these settings are
        compromised then unauthorized persons can decipher the
        message. Some procedures use a second secret table with
        message keys in addition to the key settings sheet. Both
        sender and receiver use a system to agree on one of the
        message keys from the table. This can be done by
        transmitting a random selected number that corresponds
        with a message key, or in a small message center by using
        the message keys one by one. If the machine settings are
        compromised and the message key table is kept secret,
        there are still 10,779,215,329 possible start positions
        (on the CX model) unknown to the attacker, which was
        still a tremendous number in the pre-computer era.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">To find the number of possible keys
        with which to set a machine we have to calculate each of
        the variable elements. These are the 6 pin wheels, the
        lugs, the print wheel offset and the initial start
        positions or message key. Theoretically there are 2<sup>47</sup>
        possible ways to set the pins on one wheel with 47 pins.
        For the CX model this gives 7.7 x 10<sup>84</sup>
        possible pin patterns for all six wheels. The limitations
        from the pin setting rules will reduce this number to 4.2
        x 10<sup>83</sup>, which is still an astronomical number.
        This is comparable with a 278 bit key for the wheels
        only. The theoretical total of possible lug combinations
        with 27 lug is 4.5 x 10<sup>59</sup> (we exclude the 5
        bars that are used for movement!). However, if we follow
        all the rules for a valid lugging this number is reduced
        to exactly 35,100. There are 26 possible offset positions
        for the print wheel. Finally, there are 47<sup>6</sup>
        possible initial start positions on the CX model. The
        total of practically possible keys is the product of all
        these results, which is 4.13 x 10<sup>99</sup> for the
        CX-52, comparable with a 331 bit key (it is estimated
        that there are only about 10<sup>80</sup> atoms in the
        entire universe!). This means that a brute-force attack
        on a CX-52 ciphertext is infeasible. In 1999 H Paul
        Greenough proposed a known-plaintext attack in
        Cryptologia </font><a

        today there is no ciphertext-only attack available for

                <p><font size="2">The C-52 and CX-52 were very
                flexible machines. They were easily customized
                according the requirements of the customer. Some
                models could be equipped with the five movement
                bars at the beginning of the drum, some with
                these bars at the end of the drum, and on some
                models all movement bars were spread all over the
                drum. These could be fixed or detachable and
                interchangeable. There were bars that always move
                a wheel, bars that move a wheel when the bar is
                slid to the left, and bars that move a wheel if
                not slid to the left. A special print wheel was
                available were you could rearrange the letters to
                add a substitution to the final encryption. It
                was also possible to have one alphabet or set of
                symbols for the cipher text and a different one
                for the plain text. This was useful when text had
                to be transmitted by international channels. For
                instance Arabic symbols for plain text, and a
                normal Latin alphabet from A to Z for the
                ciphertext. There was also a special RT (Random
                Tape) version with a tape reader on the front
                (see photo left - copyright John Alexander).
                Different pin wheels with customized labels could
                be produced. All these variations made it
                possible to manufacture a unique machine with its
                own unique cryptographic characteristics for each
                customer, country or service.</font></p>
