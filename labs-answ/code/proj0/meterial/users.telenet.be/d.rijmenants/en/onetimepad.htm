                (OTP), also called Vernam-cipher or the perfect
                cipher, is a crypto algorithm where plaintext is
                combined with a random key. It is the only
                existing mathematically unbreakable encryption.</font><p><font
                size="2">Used by Special Operations teams and
                resistance groups during WW2, popular with
                intelligence agencies and their spies during the
                Cold War and beyond, protecting diplomatic and
                military message traffic around the world for
                many decades, the one-time pad gained a
                reputation as a simple yet solid encryption
                system with an absolute security which is
                unmatched by today's modern crypto algorithms.
                Whatever technological progress may come in the
                future, one-time pad encryption is, and will
                remain, the only truly unbreakable system that
                provides real long-term message secrecy.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">We can only talk about one-time
                pad if some important rules are followed. If
                these rules are applied correctly, the one-time
                pad can be proven unbreakable (see Claude
                Shannon's &quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy
                Systems&quot;). Even infinite computational power
                and infinite time cannot break one-time pad
                encryption, simply because it is mathematically
                impossible. However, if only one of these rules
                is disregarded, the cipher is no longer
                unbreakable.</font></p>

                        long as the message or data that must be

                    <li><font size="2">The key is truly random

                    <li><font size="2">There should only be two
                        copies of the key: one for the sender and

                or one-time encryption is not to be confused with
                one-time keys (OTK) or one-time passwords
                (sometimes also denoted as OTP). Such one-time
                keys, limited in size, are only valid for a
                single encryption session by some
                crypto-algorithm under control of that key. Small
                one-time keys are by no means unbreakable,
                because the security of the encryption depends on
                the crypto algorithm they are used for.<br>

                <p><font size="2">The story of one-time pad
                starts in 1882, when the Californian banker Frank
                Miller compiles his &quot;Telegraphic Code to
                Insure Privacy and Secrecy in the Transmission of
                Telegrams&quot;. Such codebooks were commonly
                used, mainly to reduce telegraph costs by
                compressing words and phrases into short
                number-codes or letter-codes. These codebooks
                provided little or no security. However, Miller's
                codebook also provided instructions for a
                superencipherment (a second encipherment layer
                over the code) by an unique method: he added
                so-called shift-numbers (the key) to the
                plaincode (words, converted into a number) and
                defined the shift-numbers as a list of irregular
                numbers that should be erased after use and never
                be used again.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">His codebook contained 14,000
                words, phrases and blanks (for customizing) and
                if during enciphering the sum of plaincode and
                key exceeded 14,000, one had to subtract 14,000
                from the sum. If during deciphering the
                ciphertext value was smaller than the key, one
                had to add 14,000 to the ciphertext and than
                subtract the key (this is basically a modulo
                14,000 arithmetic). If the shift-numbers were
                randomly chosen and used once only, the modular
                arithmetic provided unbreakable encryption.
                Miller had invented the first ever one-time pad.
                Unfortunately, Miller's perfect cipher never
                became generally known, got lost in the history
                of cryptography and never received the deserved
                credits. As early as it was invented, so soon it
                disappeared in oblivion, only to be rediscovered
                in archives in 2011.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Then, in 1917, AT&amp;T
                research engineer Gilbert Vernam developed a
                system to encrypt teletype TTY communications.
                Although Vernam's invention mathematically
                resembles Miller's idea, he devised a
                electromechanical system, completely different to
                Miller's pen-and-paper algorithm. Therefore, it
                seems unlikely that Vernam borrowed Miller's
                idea. Vernam mixed a five-bit Baudot-coded
                punched paper tape, containing the message, with
                a second punched paper tape, the key, containing
                random five-bit values. To mix the punched tapes,
                a modulo 2 addition (later known as the Boolean
                XOR or Exclusive OR) was performed with relays,
                and the key tape ran synchronously on the sending
                and receiving TELEX machine. It was the first
                automated instant on-line encryption system. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Vernam realized that encryption
                with short key tapes (basically a poly-alphabetic
                cipher) would not provide enough security.
                Initially, Vernam used a mix of two key tape
                loops, with relatively prime length, creating one
                very long random key. Captain Joseph Mauborgne
                (later Chief of the U.S. Signal Corps) showed
                that even the double key tape system could not
                resist cryptanalysis if large volumes of message
                traffic were encrypted. Mauborgne concluded that
                only if the key tape is unpredictable, as long as
                the message and used only once, the message would
                be secure. Moreover, the encryption proved to be
                unbreakable. One-time encryption was reborn.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">NSA called Vernam's 1919
                one-time tape (OTT) patent &quot;perhaps one of
                the most important in the history of
                cryptography&quot;. AT&amp;T marketed the Vernam
                system in the 1920s for commercial secure
                communications, albeit with little success. The
                production, distribution and consumption of
                enormous quantities of one-time tapes limited its
                use to fixed stations (headquarters or
                communications centers). It was not until the
                Second World War that the US Signal Corps widely
                used the OTT system for its high level
                teleprinter communications. However, three German
                cryptologists did immediately recognized the
                advantages of one-time encryption.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In the early 1920s, the German
                cryptologists Werner Kunze, Rudolf Schauffler and
                Erich Langlotz cryptanalysed French diplomatic
                traffic. These pencil-and-paper numerical codes
                used code books to convert words and phrases into
                digits. The French added a short repetitive
                numerical key (by modulo 10) to encrypt the code
                book values. The German cryptologists had no
                problem in breaking these short keys but realized
                that adding a unique random key digit to each
                individual code group digit would make the
                message unbreakable. They devised a system with
                paper sheets containing random digits, each digit
                to be used once only, and the sheets, of which
                there were only two copies (one for sender and
                one for receiver), should be destroyed after use.
                In fact, they re-invented Frank Miller's 1882
                system.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">By 1923, the system was
                introduced in the German foreign office to
                protect their diplomatic correspondence (see
                image right). For the first time in history,
                diplomats had truly unbreakable encryption at
                their disposal. Later on, many variations on this
                pencil-and-paper system were devised. The name
                one-time pad (OTP) refers to small note pads with
                random digits or letters, usually printed in
                groups of five. For each new message, a new sheet
                is torn off. They are often printed as small very
                booklets or on microfilm for covert
                communications.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In 1943, one-time pads became
                the main cipher of the Special Operations
                Executive (SOE) to replace insecure poem based
                transposition ciphers and book ciphers. The
                system was used extensively during and after the
                Second World War by many intelligence
                organizations, sabotage and espionage units. The
                unbreakable encryption protects operatives and
                their contacts against decryption of their
                communications and disclosure of their
                identities. Such level of security cannot be
                guaranteed with other encryption systems during
                long-running operations because the opponent
                might have enough time to successfully decrypt
                the messages. The Soviets relied heavily on OTP's
                and OTT's during and after the Second World War
                for their armed forces and intelligence
                organizations, making much of their vital
                communications virtually impenetrable.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">On the right you find various
                different versions of one-time pads. The plastic
                pouch with one-time pad sheets and the table to
                convert text into digits were used by the
                East-German foreign intelligence service HVA. The
                Canadian intelligence service seized a miniature
                one-time pad booklet, a microdot reader and
                special lens, cleverly concealed in a toy truck
                that was brought into Canada by the young son of
                a foreign intelligence operative that entered the
                country to carry out espionage. The German
                one-time pad folder, used for official
                communications between Saigon and Berlin,
                consists of a sealed folder with one hundred
                one-time pad worksheets, numbered 6500 to 6599.
                Each sheet contains random numbers and enough
                space to write down the message and perform the
                calculations. The last image is part of a
                one-time pad, used by Aleksandr Ogorodnik, a
                Soviet Foreign Ministry employee who committed
                espionage for the CIA (click to enlarge).<br>

                one-time pads is hardly mentioned in official
                documents (for obvious security reasons).
                Nevertheless, I came across documents from the
                India Office Records in the British Library. They
                show how the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), a
                subsidiary of American Standard Oil of California
                that operated in the Persian Gulf, was given
                permission in 1943 to use one-time pads to
                communicate with its offices in New York. The
                pads were allocated to them by the U.S. Navy
                Department and vetted by the British Cipher
                Security Officer of PAIFORCE (Persia and Iraq
                Force, a British and Commonwealth military
                formation in the Middle East from 1942 to 1943).
                They show the official use of one-time letter
                pads by Political Residents of the British
                Imperial Civil Administration, the British Army,
                the Ministry of War Transport in London and the
                U.S. Navy, at least as early as 1943 and,
                surprisingly, even shared them with commercial
                firms. See also </font><a

                <p><font size="2">The use of pencil-and-paper
                one-time pads is limited because of the practical
                and logistical issues and the low message volume
                it can process. One-time pads were widely used by
                foreign service communicators until the 1980s,
                often in combination with code books. These code
                books contained all kinds of words or entire
                phrases, which were represented by a three or
                four figure code. For special names or
                expressions, not listed in the codebook, there
                were codes included that represent one letter
                that allowed the spelling of words. There was a
                book to encode, sorted by alphabet and/or
                category, and a book to decode, sorted by
                numbers. These books were valid for a long period
                of time and were not only to encode the message -
                which would be a poor encryption method by itself
                - but especially to reduce its length for
                transmission over commercial cable or telex.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Once the message was converted
                into numbers, the communicator enciphered these
                numbers with the one-time pad. Usually there was
                a set of two different pads, one for incoming and
                one for outgoing messages. Although a one-time
                pad normally has only two copies of a key, one
                for sender and one for receiver, some systems
                used more than two copies to address multiple
                receivers. The pads were like note blocks with
                random numbers on each small page, but with the
                edges sealed. One could only read the next pad by
                tearing off the previous pad. Each pad was used
                only once and destroyed immediately. This system
                enabled absolute secure communication. An
                excellent description of Canadian Foreign Service
                one-time pads is found on </font><a

                <p><font size="2">Intelligence agencies use
                one-time pads to communicate with their agents in
                the field. The perfect and long-term security
                protects the identity of convert agents, their
                assets and operations abroad. With one-time pad,
                spies don't have to carry crypto systems or use
                insecure computer software. They can carry a
                large number of one-time pad keys in very small
                booklets, on microfilm or even printed on
                clothing. These are easy to hide and to destroy.
                One way to send one-time pad encrypted messages

                Germany intelligence agency. With the TAPIR
                table, the plain text is converted into figures
                by a table, similar to the straddling
                checkerboard, prior to encryption with one-time
                pad. The most frequent letters are converted into
                a single-digit value, and the other letters,
                commonly used bigrams, figures and signs are
                converted in double-digit values. Next, the
                digits are encrypted by subtracting the key from
                the plain text numbers. The TAPIR table
                suppresses peaks in digit frequency distribution
                and the irregular single and double digit values
                create fractionation. WR 80 is a carriage return.
                Bu 81 (Buchstaben) and Zi 82 (Ziffern) are used
                to switch between letters (yellow) and figures

                replacing long words or phrases, obtained from a
                codebook. Such codebooks can have an odd code

        <p><font size="2">Until the 1980s, one-time-tapes were
        widely used to secure Telex communications. The Telex
        machines used Vernam's original one-time-tape (OTT)
        principle. The system was simple but solid. It required
        two identical reels of punched paper tape with truly
        random five-bit values, the so-called one-time tapes.
        These were distributed beforehand to both sender and
        receiver. Usually, the message was prepared (punched) in
        plain onto paper tape. Next, the message was transmitted
        on a Telex machine with the help of a tape reader, and
        one copy of the secret one-time tape ran synchronously
        with the message tape on a second tape reader. Before
        exiting the machine, the five-bit signals of both tape
        readers were mixed by performing an Exclusive OR (XOR)
        function, thus scrambling the output. On the other end of
        the line, the scrambled signal entered the receiving
        machine and was mixed, again by XOR, with the second copy
        of the secret one-time tape. Finally, the resulting
        readable five-bit signal was printed or perforated on the
        receiving machine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">A unique advantage of the punched paper
        tape keys was that copying them quickly was virtually
        impossible. The long tapes (which were sealed in plastic
        before use) were on a reel and printed with serial
        numbers and other markings on the side. To unwind the
        tape, copy it and rewind it again with a perfectly
        aligned print was very unlikely and such one-time tapes
        were therefore more secure than other keys sheets that
        were copied quickly by taking a photo or writing them
        over by hand.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Below are three images of the famous
        Washington-Moscow hotline, encrypted with one-time tapes.
        The Hotline became operational in 1963 and was a full
        duplex teleprinter (Telex) circuit. Although the Hotline
        always was shown as a red telephone in movies and popular
        culture, the option of a speech link was turned down
        immediately as it was believed that spontaneous verbal
        communications could lead to miscommunications,
        misperceptions, incorrect translation or unwise
        spontaneous remarks, which are serious disadvantages in
        times of crisis. Nevertheless, the red phone myth lived a
        long life.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The real hot line was a direct cable
        link, routed from Washington over London, Copenhagen,
        Stockholm and Helsinki to Moscow. It was a double link
        with commercial teleprinters, one link with a Teletype
        Corp Model 28 ASR teleprinter with English characters and
        the other link with East German T-63 teleprinters with
        Cyrillic character. The links were encrypted with
        one-time tapes by means of four ETCRRM's (Electronic
        Teleprinter Cryptographic Regenerative Repeater Mixer).
        The one-time tape encryption provided unbreakable
        encryption, absolute security and privacy. Although a
        highly secure system, the unclassified standard
        teleprinters and ETCRRM's were sold by commercial firms
        and therefore did not disclose any secret crypto
        technology to the opponent.</font></p>

        enable the storage of huge quantities of random key data,
        allowing secure encryption of large volumes of data.
        One-time encryption still is, and will continue to be,

        <p><font size="2">There are many different ways to apply
        one-time pad encryption. All of them are absolutely
        secure if the rules of one-time pad are followed. We can
        apply one-time pad with letters or numbers. In our first
        example we will demonstrate the use of letters. The OTP
        keys are sometimes called OTLP (One-Time Letter Pad) and
        result of encryption is always a letters-only ciphertext.
        This letters-only system is less flexible than a numbers
        based system but requires only one ciphertext letter for
        each plaintext letter and a single encryption step, which
        makes it pretty fast for a manual system. It's therefore
        ideal when the messages mostly consist of letters and
        rarely require spelling out numbers or punctuations.</font></p>

        large volumes of messages. For each key letter there's
        another alphabet of which the cipher alphabet is reversed

        <p><font size="2">Another way to calculate letter
        one-time pads without a Vigenere table, although more
        elaborate, is to perform a modulo 26 calculation. We
        assign each letter a numerical value (e.g. A=0, B=1 C=3
        and so on through Z=25). Note that we start with A=0 and
        not A=1 to enable the use of modulo 26. Text and key
        values are added together (this time with carry!), with
        modulo 26: if a value is more than 25, we subtract 26
        from that value. Finally, we convert the result back into
        letters. To decipher the message, we convert the
        ciphertext and one-time pad key into numerical values and
        subtract, by modulo 26, the one-time pad from ciphertext
        (if a value is less than 0 we add 26 to that value). </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">This is the most flexible system that
        allows many variations. Usually, encryption is performed
        by subtracting the random one-time pad key from the
        plaintext and decryption by adding the ciphertext and key
        together. Note that enciphering by addition and
        deciphering by subtraction works just as good, as long as
        sender and receiver agree upon using the opposite
        calculations.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Before we can perform the calculations
        with the plaintext and key we need to convert the text
        into digits. A most basic but less efficient method is to
        assign a two-digit value to each letter (e.g. A=01, B=02
        and so on through Z=26). A more economic system is a
        so-called </font><a href="table.htm"><font size="2">straddling
        checkerboard</font></a><font size="2"> that converts the
        most frequently used letters into one-digit values and
        the other letters into two-digit values. This results in
        a ciphertext that is considerably smaller than a basic
        two-digit system. Various checkerboards exist with
        different character sets and symbols, optimized for
        different languages and particular purposes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Note that this text-to-digit conversion
        itself is by no means secure and must be followed by an
        encryption! Therefore, we call the converted text a
        plaincode, to stress that the digits are still in
        readable form. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The first row of the checkerboards
        contains the most frequent characters with some blanks
        between them. The following rows (as many as there were
        blanks in the top row) contain the remaining letters.
        These following rows are designated by the digits above
        the blanks in the top row. Checkerboards are memorized by
        the top row letters, which can depend on the language it
        is optimized for. Some example mnemonics are &quot;</font><font
        size="2" face="Courier New">AT-ONE-SIR</font><font
        size="2">&quot; and &quot;</font><font size="2"

        (English), &quot;</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">DEIN--STAR</font><font
        size="2">&quot; and &quot;</font><font size="2"

        face="Courier New">ZA---OWIES</font><font size="2">&quot;
        (Polish). Such word combinations are easily composed with
        an anagram generator. More blanks in the top row gives
        more additional rows and thus more characters. There's no
        need to keep this table secret or scramble the order of
        the digits or letters because one-time encryption
        follows.</font></p>

        into text. It's easy to separate the one-digit values
        from the two-digit values. If a digit combination starts
        with row number 2 or 6, it is a two-digit code and

        <p><font size="2"><strong>Important Note</strong>:
        Although we use a recording from an actual numbers
        station (Lincolnshire Poacher, E3 Voice), the one-time
        pad key is fictitious and reverse-calculated (key =
        plaintext - ciphertext) so that a readable but fictitious
        message is obtained when using this key. In reality, we
        don't know which key was used, whether we must add or
        subtract and there is no way to decipher the original
        message. In fact, since a one-time pad key is truly
        random, one can calculate any plaintext from a given
        ciphertext, as long as you use the 'right' wrong key.
        That's exactly why one-time pad is unbreakable.<br>

        <p><font size="2">There is a special way to use one-time
        pad where the key is not to be destroyed. When
        information should be available only when two people
        agree to reveal that information, we can use secret
        splitting. The secret information is encrypted with a
        single one-time pad whereupon the original plaintext is
        destroyed. One user receives the encrypted message and
        the other user the key. In fact, it doesn't matter who
        gets which, since both pieces of information can be seen
        as equal, encrypted parts of the original information.
        The split parts are both called keys. Both these keys are
        useless without each other. This is called secret
        splitting. One could encrypt for example the combination
        to a safe and give the split ciphertext to two different
        individuals. Only when they both agree upon opening the
        safe, will it be possible to decipher the combination to
        the safe. You could even split information into three or
        more pieces by using two or more keys. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In this little example Charlie splits
        his secret safe combination 21 46 03 88. A random key is
        subtracted digit by digit, without carry, from the
        combination numbers. Alice and Bob both receive one piece
        of the information from Charlie. It's mathematically
        impossible for both Alice and Bob to retrieve the
        combination numbers unless they share their keys. This is
        done by simply adding the keys (without carry).</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Of course, we could also use secure
        splitting on text to encrypt passwords and such. Just
        convert the text into numbers (e.g.. A=01, B=02 and so on
        through Z=26) or use a </font><a href="table.htm"><font
        size="2">straddling checkerboard</font></a><font size="2">.
        To split the secret into more parts, just add a one-time
        key for each of the new persons. For three persons you
        must subtract two keys (without carry) from the plaintext
        to obtain the ciphertext (e.g. 2 - 4 - 9 = 9 Because 2 -
        4 = 12 - 4 = 8 and 8 - 9 = 18 - 9 = 9). Instead of
        keeping your secret password in an envelop, you could
        split it and give the shares to different persons, of
        which at least one is trusted. One person could never act
        on his own and approval of a second person is always
        required. When granddad, old and sick, splits the secret
        combination from the safe that contains his money and
        gives each of his children one part, they can only get
        their hands on his money if they all agree (not that this
        will make him live longer).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">However, since this system is
        unbreakable, all information is lost if one of the shares
        goes missing. There's no way back if a share is lost or
        destroyed by accident! It might be useful to have one
        extra copy of your share somewhere on a secure location. </font></p>

        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">Modular
        arithmetic has interesting properties that play a vital
        role in cryptography and it is also essential to the
        security of one-time pad encryption. The result of an
        encryption process could reveal information about the key
        or the plaintext. Such information might either point to
        possible solutions or enable the codebreaker to discard
        some wrong assumptions. The codebreaker will use this
        information as a lever to break open the encrypted
        message. By using modular arithmetic on the result of a
        calculation we can obscure the original values that were
        used to calculate that result.</font></p>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">In
        mathematics, modulo x is the remainder after the division
        of a positive number by x. Some examples: 16 modulo 12 =
        4 because 16 divided by 12 is 1 and this leaves a
        remainder of 4. Also, 16 modulo 10 is 6 because 16
        divided by 10 is 1 and thus leaves a remainder of 6.
        Fortunately, there's a far easier way to understand and
        work with modular arithmetic.</font></p>

        arithmetic works similarly to counting hours, but on a
        decimal clock. If the hand of our clock is at 7 and we
        add 4 by advancing clockwise, we pass the 0 and arrive at
        1. Likewise, when the clock shows 2 and we subtract 4,
        advancing anticlockwise, we arrive at 8. Modular
        arithmetic is very valuable to cryptography because the
        result value reveals absolutely no information about the
        two values that were added or subtracted. If the result
        of a modulo 10 addition is 4, we have no idea whether
        this is the result of 0 + 4, 1 + 3, 2 + 2, 3 + 1, 4 + 0,
        5 + 9, 6 + 8, 7 + 7, 8 + 6 or 9 + 5. The value 4 is the
        result of an equation with two unknowns, which is
        impossible to solve.</font></p>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">The

            <li><font size="2">Mod 10 for digits as they can have

            <li><font size="2">Mod 2 for bits as they can have

                256 values (0 - 255)</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">Modulo
        10 is very easy to perform by adding without carry and
        subtracting without borrowing, which basically means
        discarding all but the most-right digit of the result. It
        could not be easier for one-time pad encryption with
        digits.</font></p>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">Performing
        modulo calculations on letters is a bit more complex and
        requires conversion into numerical values. If we combine
        the letter X (23) with key Z (25) modulo 26, the result
        will be 22 (W) because (23 + 25) mod 26 = 22. That's way
        more elaborate and slower than decimal modulo 10.
        Fortunately, we can use the Vigenere Square or a circular
        Vigenere cipher disk to perform modulo 26 easily without
        any calculations. Note that you should never assign the
        values 1 through 26 to the letters because the result of
        a modulo calculation can be zero, for example (25 + 1)
        mod 26 = 0.</font></p>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">Modular
        calculations with bits and bytes are actually Exclusive
        OR operations (XOR) in Boolean modular arithmetic. XOR is
        used in computer programming to combine a data bit with a
        random key bit or to combine a data byte with a random
        key byte.</font></p>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">Let's
        show the danger of not using modular arithmetic. With
        normal addition, the ciphertext result 0 can only mean
        that both key and plaintext have the value 0. A
        ciphertext result of 1 means that the two unknowns can
        only be 0 + 1 or 1 + 0. With result 2, the unknowns can
        only be 0 + 2, 1 + 1 or 2 + 0. Thus, for some ciphertext
        result values we can either immediately determine the
        unknowns or we can see which unknowns of the equation
        could be possible or impossible.</font></p>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">Suppose
        we add the letter X (23) with key Z (25) without modulo.
        In that case, the result would be ciphertext 48, as we
        cannot convert 48 into a letter. However, although both
        plain letter and truly random key are unknown, we can
        draw some important conclusions: the total of 48 is only
        possible with combinations X (23) + Z (25), Y (24) + Y
        (24) or Z (25) + X (23). By merely looking at the
        ciphertext, we can discard all letters A through W as
        possible candidates for that particular plaintext and key
        letter.</font></p>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">This
        is also the reason why you should never use text that is
        converted into digits as numerical key for a one-time pad
        (some book ciphers use this system). The result wil never
        be random as it consists of a limited range of 26
        elements (0-25 or 1-26) instead of 10 elements (0-9) or
        100 (0-99), resulting in a completely insecure ciphertext
        with a tremendous bias.</font></p>
        <p id="bkj10" goog_docs_charindex="1"><font size="2">These
        simple examples show how a ciphertext can leak
        information that is very valuable to the codebreaker,
        simply because normal instead of modular arithmetic was
        used to calculate the ciphertext. Not using modular
        arithmetic always causes a biased ciphertext instead of
        the truly random ciphertext result from modular
        arithmetic. Any bias is as valuable as gold to the
        codebreaker. Modular arithmetic is therefore vital to the
        security of the one-time pad. Never use one-time pad
        encryption without applying modular arithmetic!<br>

        <p><font size="2">Is one-time pad encryption absolutely
        secure and unbreakable when all rules are applied
        correctly? Yes! It's also easy to show why, because the
        system is simple and transparent. It all comes down to
        two simple basic facts that are easily understood:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">One time pad is an equation with two
        unknowns, one of which is truly random.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">When a truly random key is combined
        with a plaintext, the result is a truly random
        ciphertext. An adversary only has the random ciphertext
        at his disposal to find key or plaintext. This is an
        equation with two unknowns, which is mathematically
        unsolvable. There is also no mathematical, statistical or
        linguistic relation whatsoever between the individual
        ciphertext characters or between different ciphertext
        messages because each individual key letter or digit is
        truly random. The modulo 26 (one-time pad with letters)
        or modulo 10 (one time pad with digits) also ensures that
        the ciphertext does not reveal any information about the
        two unknowns in the equation (see previous paragraph).
        These properties render useless all existing
        cryptanalytic tools that are available to the
        codebreaker.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Suppose we have the piece of ciphertext
        &quot;QJKES&quot;, enciphered with a one-time letter pad.
        If someone had infinite computational power he could go
        through all possible keys (a brute force attack). He
        would find out that applying the key XVHEU on ciphertext
        QJKES would produce the (correct) word TODAY.
        Unfortunately, he would also find out that the key FJRAB
        would produce the word LATER, and even worse, DFPAB would
        produce the word NEVER. He has no idea which key is the
        correct one. In fact, you can produce any desired word or
        phrase from any one-time pad -encrypted message, as long
        as you use the 'right' wrong key. There is no way to
        verify if a solution is the right one. Therefore, the

        examples again show that we can produce any plaintext
        from any ciphertext, as long as we apply the
        &#147;proper&#148; wrong key. Since the plaintext is
        determined by a series of truly random key digits,
        mathematically unrelated to each other, we have
        absolutely no idea whether the chosen key is correct. Any
        readable solution is mathematically and statistically
        equally possible and appears valid. There is no way to
        verify the solution, as it originates from random digits.
        The system is therefore information-theoretically secure.
        You have an unbreakable cipher. It's the only existing
        unbreakable cipher and it will stay unbreakable forever,

        a deterministic algorithm the attacker could find a
        method to predict the output of the key generator. If for
        instance a crypto algorithm is used to generate a random
        key, the security of the one-time pad is lowered to the
        security of the used algorithm and is no longer

        one-time pad. To exploit reused one-time pads we can use
        a heuristic method of trial and error. This simple method
        enables the complete, or at least partial, deciphering of
        all messages. This can even be done with pencil and
        paper, although it is a slow and cumbersome process. The
        principle is as follows: a crib, which is a presumed
        piece in the first plaintext, is used to
        reverse-calculate a piece of the key. This presumed key
        is than applied at the same position on the second
        ciphertext. If the presumed crib was correct than this
        will reveal a readable part of the second ciphertext and
        provide clues to expand the cribs. In the following
        example we will demonstrate the breaking of two messages,
        only with the aid of pencil and paper.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">We
        have two completely different ciphertext messages,

        with the same one-time pad, but we have no knowledge of
        that key. Let us begin with assuming that the letters are
        converted into digits by assigning them the values A=01
        trough Z=26, that the enciphering is performed by
        subtracting the key from the plaintext without borrowing
        (5 - 8 = 15 - 8 = 7) and that deciphering is performed by
        adding ciphertext and key together without carry (7 + 6 =
        3 and not 13). This is a standard and unbreakable
        application of one-time pad, if only they had never used
        that one-time pad twice! The reason I use the basic A=01
        to Z=26 is to make it easier to see the separate letters.
        The described heuristic analysis works also with a
        straddling checkerboard (one-digit and two-digit

        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">First,
        we must search for a crib. A crib is an assumed piece of
        plaintext that corresponds to a given ciphertext. These
        can be commonly used words, parts of words, or frequently
        used trigrams or bigrams. Some examples of frequent
        trigrams in the English language are &quot;THE&quot;,
        &quot;AND&quot;, &quot;ING&quot;, &quot;HER&quot; and
        &quot;HAT&quot;. Frequent bigrams are &quot;TH&quot;,
        &quot;AN&quot;, &quot;TO&quot;, &quot;HE&quot;,
        &quot;OF&quot; and &quot;IN&quot;. Of course, a crib
        should be as long as possible. If you know who sent the
        message and what he might be talking about you could try
        out complete words.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">In
        our example, we don't have any presumed words, so we'll
        have to use some other group of letters. Let's try the
        crib &quot;THE&quot;, which is the most frequently used
        trigram in the English language. Now, in this example we
        only have one small piece of ciphertext. In real life,
        you might have a few hundred digits at your disposal for
        testing, which makes a successful crib more likely.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">We
        align the letters &quot;THE&quot; with every position of
        ciphertext &quot;A&quot; and subtract the ciphertext from
        the crib. The result is the assumed one-time key. In
        heuristic terms, this is our trial. To test it, we add
        the assumed key to ciphertext &quot;B&quot; to recover
        plaintext &quot;B&quot;. Unfortunately, as shown
        underneath the first &quot;THE&quot; of the example, we
        get our heuristic error. We continue to try out all
        positions. For the sake of simplicity, I only show three
        example positions of the crib. Our trial and error will
        show us that the 9th character position (17th digit)
        provides a possible correct plaintext &quot;B&quot;, the
        trigram &quot;OCU&quot;.</font></p>

        STATIC&quot;, and &quot;O THE&quot; might be expandable
        to &quot;TO THE&quot;, as &quot;TO&quot; is a popular
        bigram that ends with the letter O. Again we must test
        these solutions by recovering the related assumed key and
        try that key out on the other ciphertext. If correct,
        this will again reveal another little readable piece of
        plaintext. Remember we started only with the assumption

        has shown many examples of negligent use of one-time pad,
        the VENONA project being the most notorious. This is a
        fine example of how important it is to follow the basic
        rules of one-time pad. Soviet Intelligence historically
        always relied heavily on one-time pad encryption, with
        good reason and success. Soviet communications have
        always proved extremely secure. However, during the
        Second World War, the Soviets had to create and
        distribute enormous quantities of one-time pad keys. Time
        pressure and tactical&nbsp;circumstances lead in some
        cases to the distribution of more than two copies of
        certain keys. In the early 1940s, the United States and
        Great Britain analyzed and stored enormous quantities of
        encrypted messages, intercepted during the war.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">American
        codebreakers discovered by cryptanalysis that a very
        small portion of the tens of thousands of KGB and GRU
        messages between Moscow and Washington were enciphered
        with reused one-time pads. The messages were encoded with
        codebooks prior to enciphering with one-time pad, making
        the task even immensely harder for the codebreakers.
        Finding out which key was reused on what message, the
        reconstruction of the codebooks and recovering the
        plaintext were enormous challenges that took years.
        Eventually they managed to reconstruct more than 3,000
        KGB and GRU messages, just because of a distribution
        error by the Soviets. VENONA was crucial in solving many
        spy cases. Although VENONA is often mistakenly referred
        to as the project that broke Soviet one-time pads, they
        never actually broke one-time pad, but exploited

        codebreaker cannot retrieve the plaintext by examining
        the ciphertext. Therefore, he will try to retrieve the
        key. If the random values for the one-time key are not
        truly random but generated by a deterministic mechanism
        or algorithm it could be possible to predict the key.

        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">In
        the pre-electronic era, true random was generated
        mechanically or electro-mechanically. Some of the most
        curious devices were developed to produce random values.
        Today, there are several options to generate truly random
        numbers. Hardware Random Number Generators (RNG's) are
        based on the unpredictability of physical events. Some
        semiconductors such as Zener diodes produce electrical
        noise in certain conditions. The amplitude of the noise
        is sampled at fixed time intervals and translated into
        binary zeros and ones.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">Another
        unpredictable source is the tolerance of electronic
        component properties and their behavior under changing
        electrical and temperature conditions. Some examples are
        ring oscillators that operate at a very high frequency,
        the drift, caused by resistors, capacitors and other
        components in oscillators or time drift of computer
        hardware. Photons, single light particles, are another
        perfect source of randomness. In such systems, a single
        photon is sent through a filter, and its state is
        measured. The quality of such randomness sources can be
        verified with statistical tests to detect failure of the
        system.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">Even
        when hardware-based true random generators are used, it
        will be necessary in some cases to improve their
        properties, for instance to prevent unequal distribution
        of zero's or one's in a sequence. One simple way to
        improve or whiten a single bit output is to sample two
        consecutive bits. The value sequence 01 would result in
        an output bit 0 and the value sequence 10 would give
        output 1. The repetitive values 00 and 11 are discarded.

        option is the manual generation of numbers. Of course,
        this time consuming method is only possible for small
        volumes of keys or key pads. Nevertheless, it's possible
        to produce truly random numbers. You could use five
        ten-sided dice (see image right). With each throw, you
        have a new five-digit group. Such dice are available in
        toy stores or you could make them yourself (</font><a

        <p><font size="2">Never ever simply use normal six-sided
        dice by adding the values of two dice. This method is
        statistically unsuitable to produce values from 0 to 9
        and thus absolutely insecure (the total of 7 will occur
        about 6 times more often that the values 2 or 12).
        Instead, use one black and one white die and assign a
        value to each of the 36 combinations, taking in account
        the order/color of the dice (see table below). This way,
        each combination has a .0277 probability (1 on 36). We
        can produce three series of values between 0 and 9. The
        remaining 6 combinations (with a black 6) are simply
        disregarded, which doesn't affect the probability of the
        other combinations.</font></p>

        could also assign the letters A through Z and numbers 0
        through 9 to all 36 dice combinations, again taking in
        account the order/color as in the table above. This way,
        you can create one-time pads that contain both letters
        and numbers. Such one-time pads can be used in
        combination with a Vigenere square, similar to the one
        described above, but with a 36 x 36 grid where each row
        contains the complete alphabet, followed by all digits.
        This will also produce a ciphertext with both letters and
        numbers. An advantage is that your plaintext can contain
        figures.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">You
        can also use lotto balls. However, after extracting a
        number, that ball must always be mixed again with the
        other balls before extracting the next ball. If random
        bit values are required you can use one or more coins
        that are flipped, with one side representing the zero's
        and the other side the one's. With 8 coins you could
        compose an 8 bit value (byte) in one throw. Many other
        manual systems can be devised, as long as statistical
        randomness is assured. These simple but effective and
        secure methods are suitable for small one-time pads or
        small keys that are used to protect passwords (see </font><a
        href="secretsplitting.htm"><font size="2">Secret
        Splitting</font></a><font size="2">). </font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">Another
        alternative is the use of a software based generator.
        However, software random number generators will <u>never</u>
        provide absolute security because of their deterministic
        nature. Crypto secure pseudo-random number generators
        (CSPRNG's) produce a random output that is determined by
        a key or seed. A large (unlimited) amount of random
        values is derived from a seed or key with a limited size,
        and seed and output are related to each other. In fact,
        you're no longer using one-time encryption, but an
        encryption with a small sized key. Brute forcing the seed
        by trying out all possible seeds, or analysis of the
        output or parts of the output could compromise the
        generator.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">There
        are techniques to improve the output of CSPRNG's. Using a
        truly random and very large seed is essential. This could
        be done by accurate time or movement measurements of
        human interaction with the computer, for instance mouse
        movements, or by measuring the drift of computer
        processes time (note that a normal computer RND function
        is totally insecure). Another technique to drastically
        improve a CSPRNG is to combine the generator output with
        multiple other generators, the so-called
        &quot;whitening&quot;. This will make analysis of the
        output much more difficult because each generator output
        obscures information about the other generator outputs.
        In the end, however, only one time pad encryption, based
        on truly random keys, is really unbreakable. More
        information about the secure generation of randomness is
        found in the IETF </font><a

        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">There's
        also the issue of secure computers to process, store or
        print the truly random numbers. Even the use of a
        hardware generator with truly random output, necessary
        for absolute security, is useless if the computer itself
        is not absolutely secure. Unfortunately, there's no such
        thing as a secure personal computer. The only absolutely
        secure computer is a physically separated computer, with
        restricted input/output peripherals, never connected to a
        network and securely stored with controlled access. Any
        other computer configuration will never guarantee
        absolute security. Cryptographic software is only secure
        on a stand-alone computer or dedicated crypto equipment. <br>

        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">One-time
        pad encryption is only possible if both sender and
        receiver are in possession of the same key. Therefore, we
        need a secure exchanged beforehand, physically through a
        trusted courier, or electronically by a perfect secure
        system like quantum key distribution. The secure
        communications are therefore expected and planned within
        a specific time frame. Enough key material must be
        available for all required communications until a new
        exchange of keys is possible. Depending upon the
        situation, a large volume of keys could be required for a
        short time period, or little key material could be
        sufficient for a very long time period, up to years or
        even decades. One-time pads are especially interesting in
        circumstances where long-term security is essential. Once
        encrypted, no single future cryptanalytic attack or
        technology will ever be able to decrypt the data. In
        contrast, information that is encrypted with current
        traditional computer algorithms will not withstand future
        codebreaking technology and can compromise people or
        organizations years after.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">Although
        one-time pad is the only perfect cipher, it has two
        disadvantages that complicate its use for some specific
        applications. The first problem is the generation of
        large quantities of random keys. We cannot produce true
        randomness with simple mechanical devices or computer
        algorithms like a computer RND function or stream
        ciphers. Hardware true random generators, usually based
        on noise, are the only secure option. The second problem
        is key distribution. The amount of key needed is equal to
        the amount of data that is encrypted and each key is for
        one-time use only. Therefore, we need to distribute large
        amounts of keys to both sender and receivers in a highly
        secure way. Of course, it would be useless to send the
        one-time pads to the receiver by encrypting them with
        AES, IDEA or another strong algorithm. This would lower
        the unbreakable security of the pads to the security
        level of the algorithm that was used. These are practical
        problems, but solutions exist to solve these problems for
        certain applications.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">Another
        disadvantage is that one-time encryption doesn't provide
        message authentication and integrity. Of course, you know
        that the sender is authentic, because he has the
        appropriate key and only he can produce a decipherable
        ciphertext, but you cannot verify if the message is
        corrupted, either by transmission errors or by an
        adversary. A solution is to use a hash algorithm on the
        plaintext and send the hash output value, encrypted along
        with the message, to the recipient (a hash value is a
        unique fixed-length value, derived from a message). Only
        the person who has the proper one-time pad is able to
        correctly encrypt the message and corresponding hash. An
        adversary cannot predict the effect of his manipulations
        on the plaintext, nor on the hash value. Upon reception,
        the message is deciphered and its content checked by
        comparing the received hash value with a hash that is
        created from the received message. Unfortunately, a
        computer is required to calculate the hash value, making
        this method of authentication impossible for a purely
        manual encryption.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">One-time
        pad encryption nevertheless has a bright future. It is in
        fact the only crypto algorithm that has any future. Once
        that computational power and codebreaking technology has
        surpassed the capabilities of cryptologists and the
        limitations of mathematics to make strong encryption,
        there will no longer be any crypto algorithm that
        survives the evolution of cryptology, unless it meets the
        standards of information-theoretical perfect security.
        Just as classical pencil-and-paper ciphers were rendered
        useless with the advent of the computer, so will current
        computer based crypto algorithms become victim to the
        evolution of technology, and that moment might creep on
        us much faster than we expect. Only one-time pad
        encryption, the only information theoretically secure
        encryption, will survive that evolution.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">Technology
        and science, instead of cryptologists, must then provide
        a solution to the key distribution issues. This can be
        some modern high-tech version of the briefcase with
        handcuffs or quantum key distribution (QKD) which is
        already in use today. QKD and one-time pad are a perfect
        combination. ECOQC in Vienna, Austria, was in 2008 the
        first ever QKD protected network. The current DARPA
        Quantum network has ten nodes. ID Quantique,
        QuintessenceLabs and SeQureNet are some of the commercial
        firms that currently offer QKD networks. One way or the
        other, one-time pad encryption and a system to distribute
        its keys, practical or impractical, will be implemented
        in the future because we will have no other choice.</font></p>
        <p id="fyw4" goog_docs_charindex="1311"><font size="2">The
        current precarious state of Internet security, or rather
        the lack of security, is where the limited use of
        one-time pad encryption for specific purposes comes into
        the play. One might have found it ridiculous in our
        high-tech world, if it wasn&#146;t for the disastrous
        state our privacy is in today. Indeed, even the pencil
        and paper one-time pad still provides a practical
        encryption system for sensitive private communications
        where the correspondents can perform all calculations by
        hand and without the aid of their insecure computers and
        unreliable network. You could call it the poor man's
        one-time pad, but it works perfectly and it is the only
        system that we can really trust today and, the best of
        all, nobody will ever be able to decipher your messages,
        not even three-letter organizations. More information
