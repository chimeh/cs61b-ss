                <td valign="top"><font size="2">The German
                Siemens &amp; Halske T-52 Geheimschreiber was an
                online teletype cipher machine for high-level
                strategic Luftwaffe (German Airforce) messages in
                the Second World War. It was one of the most
                secure German cipher machine. The early T-52a and
                T-52b versions were less secure. Their traffic
                was broken by Swedish cryptologists in 1940 and
                these messages were read throughout the war. The
                British codebreakers discovered the use of the
                T-52 in 1942 and codenamed its message traffic
                STURGEON. Although they succeeded in breaking a
                small part of STURGEON, they did not achieve the
                same success as they had with the Enigma and
                Lorenz machines. The T-52 enciphering was by far
                the most complex one. However, an important
                mistake by the Luftwaffe was that their messages
                were often sent through both T-52 and Enigma.
                With the Enigma broken on a regular basis, the
                T-52 traffic became less important and Bletchley
                Park gave priority to the Enigma traffic.</font><p><font
                size="2">The T-52 was basically a combination of
                a Telex machine and a cipher machine. It used ten
                pinwheels of different sizes of which the output
                states were XORed with each other in a complex
                fashion. The output of these logic functions was
                mixed with the standard five-bit Telex signal of
                the machine through XORing and swapping of the
                bits. The early T-52a and T-52b had several
                security flaws and were less secure. The T-52c
                had a more complex logic mixing of the pinwheel
                output and the T-52d incorporated a highly
                irregular stepping of the wheels, controlled by
                cams. The T-52e was a combination of the
                improvements of the T-52c and T-52d, and was a
                highly secure machine.</font></p>

                <td valign="top"><font size="2">The American
                SIGABA was probably the most secure rotor cipher
                machine during WW2. The SIGABA ECM Mark II (CSP
                888/889) had three banks of five rotors each. One
                set of five rotors was used to encrypt the
                alphabet. The other two banks of rotors were used
                to scramble the signals that control the movement
                of the encryption rotors. The result is a very
                irregular and complex stepping of the encryption
                rotors. The SIGABA was a most secure machine and
                its message traffic has never been broken. It
                remained in service until the 1950s, when it was
                replaced by more modern systems such as the KL-7
                and on-line ciphering machines.</font><p><font
                size="2">During WW2 the US and Britain both
                developed a compatible cipher machine system,
                based on their own machines. On American side the
                special SIGABA CCM (Combined Cipher Machine),
                designated ASAM 5 by the Army and CSP-1700 by the
                Navy, was equipped with the CSP-1600 Typex
                compatible rotor cage. This machine was
                interoperable with the CCM version of the British
                Typex cipher machine. After the war, the CCM
                remained in service between The US, Britain and
                Canada, and later on within NATO.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The SIGABA was a wonderful
                machine that incorporated the newest developments
                in the field of cipher machines. Unfortunately
                all machines were systematically withdrawn and
                destructed for reasons of security. Only a
                hand-full most rare ECM Mark II's survived in
                museums and the special SIGABA CCM version is an
                even more endangered species. The story of the
                Famous German Enigma cipher machine is now widely
                known to the public, but regretfully the SIGABA
                with its far better cryptographic strength as the
                Enigma is only known within the world of
                cryptography.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">More information is available
                on several good websites. On the Pampanito

                Converter M-209-B, manufactured by L.C.
                Smith-Corona Typewriters. In 1940, the US
                military selected the Hagelin C-38 as tactical
                ciphering device and designated it as M-209. The
                US Navy designated it CSP-1500. It was a lunchbox
                sized - highly portable - cipher machine with a
                simple and compact but ingenious design. By the
                end of the Second World War over 140,000 of these
                small M-209 machines were produced in the US. The
                M-209 is a typical pin-and-lug cipher machine
                with six relatively prime sized pin wheels, a
                drum with 27 sliding bars and a
                letter-dial/print-drum with reciprocal alphabet.
                Although the M-209 was not very secure, the easy
                to use and small machine was ideal for use in
                tactical circumstances where the content of the
                messages was no longer of importance after a few

                (Electronic Teleprinter Cryptographic
                Regenerative Repeater Mixer) from the Norwegian
                company STK (Standard Telefon og Kabelfabrik A/S)
                applied one-time encryption on a standard
                commercial teleprinter. The ETCRRM mixed the
                five-bit Telex output signal with a one-time tape
                by XOR-ing both signals. An identical setup on
                the receiver's end, with an identical key tape
                stream, reversed the enciphering process. The
                one-time tapes or key tapes were truly random
                five-bit values. As long as there are only two
                copies of a one-time tape, these tapes are used
                only once and they are destroyed after use, the
                messages that are sent by this systems are
                mathematically unbreakable. The ETCRRM used
                tubes, relays and diodes to implement the logic
                XOR functions. A solenoid and ratchet system, the
                only mechanical parts in the machine, advanced
                the key tape.</font><p><font size="2">The ETCRRM
                was used for high level military communications
                in several countries. ETCRRM's were also used on
                the Washington/Moscow Hot-line. Two were
                installed in Washington and two in Moscow.
                Although a system with absolute security, the
                unclassified standard teleprinters and ETCRRM's
                were sold by commercial firms and therefore did
                not disclose any secret crypto technology to the
                Soviets. Only the key tapes were considered
                secret crypto material. The Hotline was a full
                duplex teleprinter circuit, and not a so called
                'Red Phone', as it was believed that spontaneous
                verbal communications could lead to
                miscommunications and misperceptions.</font></p>

                &quot;JASON&quot; was the receiver part of the
                KW-37 crypto system, developed by the NSA In the
                1950s. The systems consisted of a KWT-37
                transmitter and a KWR-37 receiver. It was used to
                secure fleet broadcasts of the US Navy. The shore
                station transmitted 24 hours a day a continuous
                stream of encrypted random data. If a message had
                to be sent to one of the ships, the encrypted
                message was inserted into the continuous stream.
                An enemy eavesdropper could not detect if or how
                many message were sent, when they started or
                ended, or how long they were. Therefore, the
                KW-37 system made traffic analysis by the
                adversary impossible. The output of the receiver
                was connected to a teletype machine that
                immediately printed the decrypted stream onto
                paper. Transmitter and receiver maintained
                synchronisation whole day. If synchronisation was
                lost, the receiving operator could re-established
                synchro by re-setting and running very fast
                through all past key stream until the KWR-37
                could pick up the current stream again.</font><p><font
                size="2">The KWR-37 was a marvel of
                miniaturisation in the 1950s. It contained
                approximately 500 miniature vacuum tubes for a
                large number of flip-flops and logic functions,
                required for the shift registers that generated
                the pseudo-random enciphering stream. The key of
                the KWR-37 was an IBM style punch card that was
                changed daily, just before the new synchro at
                midnight. The machine remained in service until
                the early 1990s.</font></p>

                FIALKA M-125 is the most famous Soviet cipher
                machine of the Cold War era. In 1965, the
                Cyrillic version was introduced in the Soviet
                Army, and later on, versions with Czech, Polish
                and (East) German keyboard layout entered service
                in the Warsaw Pact. The FIALKA was operational
                until at least the 1990s and according to some
                sources even still in use today. Therefore, the
                FIALKA and its specifications were top secret
                until the late 1990s. The image shows the
                M-125-3MP2 version with Czech keyboard. </font><p><font
                size="2">Although based on the WW2 German Enigma
                machine, Russian cryptologists were well aware of
                the security flaws of the Enigma and incorporated
                solutions to all of those flaws into this
                wonderful piece of mechanics. The small machine,
                only 10.8 by 12.5 inches and 8.3 inches high, is
                with its impressive mechanism the Swiss watch of
                the electro-mechanical cipher machines. The
                Fialka has 10 interchangeable, alternately
                counter-rotating rotors with 30 wirings each.
                Pins on each rotor mechanically control the
                irregular and most complex stepping of the
                rotors. The disassemblable internal wirings core
                of each rotor can be rotated, extracted and
                mirrored, or exchanged with other wirings.
                Several different types of rotor sets were
                produced. The plugboard, as used on the Enigma,
                is replaced by a punched card reader, and an
                electronic 3-point circuit in the reflector
                solves Enigma's flaw that a letter can never be
                encrypted into itself. The output is printed on a
                paper ribbon or punched on a five-bit paper tape,
                and the machine is also equipped with a paper
                tape reader.</font></p>

                (NSA) as a successor of the SIGABA. The machine
                entered service in 1952. ADONIS and POLLUX were
                two different encryption procedures for the KL-7.
                The American ADONIS procedure applied an
                encrypted message key to preset the initial
                startposition of the rotors, whereas the
                &#145;export version&#146; POLLUX procedure used
                far less secure non-encrypted message keys. The
                KL-7 was compromised by John Walker who sold
                technical information and key lists to the
                Soviets. The KL-7 was used by the US and many of
                its Allies and retired in 1983.</font><p><font
                size="2">Output of the KL-7 was printed on a
                paper ribbon and some versions had a paper
                puncher for 5-bit code output. The KL-7 has eight
                rotors (the fourth from the left was stationary)
                with 36 contacts each. During its service time,
                the rotors were recalled and re-wired regularly.
                The rotors are placed in a rotor basket, called
                KLK-7 which can be removed from the machine base
                KLB-7. Each rotor is placed in a plastic outer
                ring with cams. Microswitches, controlled by
                these cams, engage electro-magnets which in turn
                step the rotors. This resulted in a highly
                irregular stepping of the rotors. The 26 inputs
                and outputs of the rotor basket are used to
                encrypt the letters. The 10 remaining inputs and
                outputs are looped back through the rotors,
                resulting in a very complex signal path for the
                26 letters. The machine was non-reciprocal. This
                was achieved by a sliding permutor board
                underneath the keyboard which swapped all input
                and output contacts of the rotor encryption. The
                exact rotor and stepping unit wiring remains
                classified. Today, all publicly availably
                machines, such as this machine from the Royal
                Dutch Signals Museum, are carefully sanitized and
                stripped of any wiring, related to the rotors and
                stepping unit.</font></p>
