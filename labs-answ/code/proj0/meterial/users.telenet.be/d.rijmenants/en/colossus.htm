                <td valign="top"><font size="2">The British
                Colossus was the first ever programmable digital
                computer. This top secret computer came into
                service at the end of 1943 and was developed to
                break German telex traffic, encrypted with the
                Lorenz SZ40/42 machines. Although Colossus
                operated two years earlier than the publicly well
                known American ENIAC, it never received the
                proper credit due to its top secret status during
                and after the war. It was only in the late 1970's
                that information about this wonderful machine
                became available. Unfortunately, this magnificent
                machine is hardly mentioned in history books.</font><h4><font
                size="2">Breaking Tunny</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">During the Second World War
                codebreakers of the GC&amp;CS - Government Code
                and Cipher School - in Bletchley Park, England,
                were tasked to break German telex messages that
                were encrypted with the Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.
                This machine secured the top secret high-level
                communications of the German armed forces.
                British codebreakers gave the codename
                &quot;Fish&quot; to all encrypted German telex
                traffic and the Lorenz machine and its traffic
                was codenamed &quot;Tunny&quot;. The Lorenz was
                an on-line cipher machine and used 12 irregular
                moving pinwheels to create a pseudo-random 5 bit
                stream which was mixed with the plain 5-bit telex
                signal. When codebreakers at Bletchley discovered
                statistical biases in the random bits, generated
                by the Lorenz machine, they developed
                cryptanalytic attacks to break the Lorenz
                messages.</font></p>
                <h4><font size="2">Building the Colossus</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">The codebreakers soon realized
                that they needed a machine to process the large
                number of Tunny messages. Early 1943 the
                mathematician Max Newman designed the &quot;Heath
                Robinson&quot;, an electro-mechanical machine to
                break the Lorenz traffic. The prototype became
                operational in June 1943 but had several
                technical problems. Meanwhile, a team lead by the
                brilliant engineer Tommy Flowers, assisted by Max
                Newman, was busy with a top secret project in the
                Post Office Research Station in Dollis Hill near
                London. His goal was to develop and build an
                advanced digital and programmable version of the
                Heath Robinson. Its name was Colossus.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The Colossus Mark I was ready
                by the end of 1943 and all parts were moved to
                Bletchley Park and assembled during the Christmas
                holidays by Don Horwood and Harry Fensom. By mid
                January 1944, Colossus was finished and began its
                task to break the top secret German
                communications. Colossus Mark II, an improved
                version followed entered service in June 1944 .
                The Mark II was 5 times faster and easier to
                program than the Mark I. The existing Colossus
                Mark I was revised, more Mark II's were built and
                a yoyal of 10 Colossus computers were
                operationalby by the end of the war .</font></p>
                <h4><font size="2">Colossus at Work</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">The Colossus was the first ever
                to use shift registers and counters, and could
                perform Boolean calculations. It was programmable
                by switches and plug panels. The Mark I had two
                racks with 1,500 vacuum tubes, Mark II had 2,500
                tubes. They were used to store the virtual Lorenz
                settings and to do the statistical calculations.
                Colossus could perform parallel calculations,
                enabling very high speed. the 5-bit paper tape,
                containing the message ciphertext, was read by a
                tape reading system and the Colossus was
                electronically synchronized with the tape. The
                tape spped was the limiting factor of the
                Colossus. Therefore, they designed a unique
                high-speed tape reader that could operate at
                speeds up to 9,700 characters per second. For
                safer use it was limited to 5,000 characters,
                which was still an incredible speed for a small
                paper ribbon! I had the opportunity to check out
                the running Colossus and its speed was very
                impressive!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The Colossus computers were
                very successful and broke an enormous number of
                top secret German messages. The information,
                obtained from the broken Tunny messages, was
                codenamed ULTRA. This classification was used for
                all critical and very sensitive information,
                obtained by cryptanalysis of enemy messages. One
                other source of ULTRA was the broken German radio
                traffic, encrypted with the Enigma cipher
                machine. ULTRA played a decisive role in the
                outcome of the Second World War.</font></p>
                <h4><font size="2">After the War</font></h4>
                <p><font size="2">Bletchley Park closed after the
                war and eight Colossus computers were destroyed
                for security reasons. The two remaining computers
                were moved together with the GC&amp;CS to
                Cheltenham. They were dismantled in 1960. After
                the war, the Colossus computers and their success
                remained top secret for decades. No one knew
                about the Colossus and, for many years, the
                American ENIAC received the undeserved credit of
                being the first programmable digital computer.
                Ironically, it was the National Security Agency
                who, by releasing old archives under the Freedom
                of Information Act at the end of the 1970's,
                showed that Colossus had beaten them by two
                years. It is now recognized that the Colossus,
                and the people who designed it, had a significant
                influence on the development of early computers.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Computer expert Tony Sale and
                his team, which included some of the original
                engineers, have reconstructed the Colossus
                computer. The input of the original designers was
                invaluable since most of the secret plans of
                Colossus were destroyed. The operational and
                running Colossus is located in Bletchley Park and
                I can highly recommend a visit.</font></p>
