        U-boats attack!</font></h4>

        alt="Image © www.german-uboats.com" align="right"
        hspace="5" width="508" height="311"></font><font size="2">At
        the beginning of the Second World War, German U-boat
        fleet commander Admiral Karl Dönitz insisted on creating
        a large fleet of at least 300 U-boats as the most
        important weapon of the Kriegmarine. They would be used
        to enforce a blockade of England in case of war. Although
        Dönitz was supported by his chief Admiral Raeder, Hitler
        refused their proposal and assured them there would never
        be a war with Britain. Battle ships would remain the main
        weapon of the Kriegsmarine and Dönitz had only 57
        U-boats.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">However, after the invasion of Poland,
        Britain declared the war to Germany on 3 September 1939,
        and the Royal Navy had almost ten times more warships
        than the Kriegsmarine. After the loss of several German
        war ships and having the destruction of Allied convoys to
        Britain as a new priority, the Kriegsmarine was forced to
        adapt their naval tactics.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The production of U-boats increased
        rapidly and Dönitz was finally able to apply his new
        strategy, the Rudel Taktik or so-called Wolf-pack
        tactics. The German Kriegsmarine proved to be very
        successful with their Wolf-pack technique. U-boats hunted
        individually for convoys. If a convoy was found, they
        shadowed their prey and other U-boats were contacted.
        Once all U-boats on the spot, they sunk the convoy with a
        closely coordinated attack. This technique was so
        devastating that it could have decided the outcome of war
        in favor of Germany. The Allies lost their ships faster
        then they could build new ones to replace them.
        Communication was the key to the success of the
        Wolf-packs, and the Kriegsmarine used Enigma to encipher
        their messages.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Hunting the shark</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The Allied Forces faced the impossible
        task to get control over the vast Atlantic Ocean.
        Surprisingly, the Kriegsmarine offered them the solution
        to this problem. In Bletchley Park, England, a team of
        codebreaker was breaking into the German Wehrmacht,
        Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine communications. All
        information, retrieved from decrypted messages, was
        codenamed 'Ultra'. Many different sections worked in
        Bletchley Park on different codes of the German armed
        forces. Each section was designated by the barracks or
        Huts where they worked in. Hugh Alexander and Alan Turing
        led the attack on the naval Enigma encryption in Hut 8.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">At the start of war, the U-boat
        communication network used the three-rotor Enigma M3 to
        encipher their messages. The M3 was identical to the
        Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe Enigma but the Kriegsmarine had a
        set of eight rotors to choose from, instead of the normal
        set of five. Initially, the main keys to encrypt Enigma
        messages on U-boats and surface ships in the home waters
        and the Atlantic were the Heimisch keys. This key,
        designated Dolphin by Bletchley Park, was the most
        important one, although many other key were operational
        on different naval locations. Despite the British Navy
        having recovered two of the three additional naval rotors
        from U-33 early in 1940 and the third rotor in August of
        the same year, Bletchley still could not break the
        Dolphin keys.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To break Dolphin, they had to know the
        daily changing rotor combinations that were used. One way
        to find out these combinations was the use of cribs.
        Cribs were little pieces of assumed text. Once the
        codebreakers located a crib in an Enigma message (there
        were techniques for that) the associations between the
        letters of the encrypted text and its plain non-encrypted
        version were entered in a Turing Bombe. This machine,
        designed by Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman, contained a
        large number of drums, each replicating the rotors of the
        Enigma, and ran through all possible settings to find the
        key settings that belong to the combination of a given
        piece of cipher and plain text. Once these settings were
        found they could decipher all messsages of that
        particular day. Unfortunately, few cribs were available
        the until summer of 1941.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Another important setting of the Enigma
        machine that had to be found was the message key, which
        was the initial rotor positions at the beginning of the
        enciphering of a message. The Kriegmarine message
        procedures were far more complex than the procedures that
        were used by the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. The
        Kriegsmarine messages keys were selected from special
        code books and different message key systems and code
        books existed for normal messages, Kurzsignalen
        (short-signals) and weather reports. Except for some
        brief periods, Blechtley was unable to get grip on the
        complex naval keys. More about the message procedures </font><a
        href="enigmaproc.htm"><font size="2">on this page.</font></a></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Dolphin broken</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/bletchley.jpg"
        align="right" hspace="5" width="508" height="330"></font><font
        size="2">A breakthrough occurred when several code books
        were secretly captured. On 9 may 1941, a Kurzsignal
        (short-signal) code book was recovered during the
        boarding of Kapitänleutnant Lemp's U-110. This code book
        proved to be important to develop new methods to attack
        Dolphin. However, attacking and boarding U-boats was a
        risky operation, especially because the operation had to
        be kept secret. Harry Hinsley, one of the Bletchley
        codebreakers, discovered that the same code books that
        were used on heavily armed U-boats were also being used
        aboard unprotected German trawlers, operating as weather
        ships for the Kriegsmarine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On 7 May 1941 HMS Somali boarded the
        weather ship München south east of Iceland. Weather ship
        Lauenburg was attacked and boarded on 28 June in the
        Arctic Ocean by HMS Nigeria, together with HMS Tartar,
        HMS Bedouin and HMS Jupiter. Both the München and
        Lauenburg were sunk after a boarding party recovered the
        Wetterkurzschlussel (weather short-signal) code books.
        The Kriegsmarine presumed both ships lost at sea.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Meanwhile, the weather section in Hut
        10 broke the manual cipher that was used for
        meteorological reports within the Kriegsmarine. These
        reports originated from the U-boats and were sent by them
        as Wetterkurzsignalen (weather short-signals). The
        U-boats first encoded these reports with the
        WetterKurzschlussel before encrypting them with Enigma. A
        Wetterkurzsignal consisted of a fixed number of letters,
        each letter representing a specific weather condition or
        value. However, having the decrypted meteorological
        reports and knowing into which codes they were converted,
        Bletchley could now guess the plain text letters in the
        original with Enigma encrypted Wetterkurzsignal from the
        U-boat. This well-thought detour provided good cribs to
        attack Dolphin.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Sometimes, due to lack of cribs,
        Bletchley Park used a technique called Gardening. British
        bombers dropped or planted series of sea mines on well
        determined places. German U-boats, spotting these mines,
        transmitted contact messages. Messages about these mines
        and about cleared sea-lines were often send by both
        Enigma and a manual cipher called Werftschlussel
        (shipyard key). After Bletchley Park broke the
        Werftschlussel, they again had a plain text version and
        Enigma enciphered version of that text, providing them
        with new cribs for their Bombes. Bletchley Park was now
        constantly breaking the U-boat messages and knew their
        battle orders and locations. This enabled the Admiralty
        to re-route Allied convoys. Things were looking good...</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Triton Strikes Back</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The dropping results made Admiral
        Dönitz suspicious. Although reassured by the Abwehr,
        German Foreign Intelligence, that Enigma was unbreakable,
        he insisted on improving the security of Enigma. On 1
        February 1942 the famous Enigma M4 model with four rotors
        and new code books were introduced. The new and more
        complicated Triton code, designated Shark by Bletchley
        Park, caused a complete black-out. They could no longer
        break the U-boat radio traffic and no longer had any idea
        of the U-boat positions. On top of that, new
        Wetterkurzschlussel code books were introduced one month
        earlier. This deprived Bletchley Park completely of any
        cribs. The Kriegsmarine called the springtime of 1942 <em>Die
        Glücklichen Zeiten</em> or Happy Times, because of the
        enormous shipload they sunk. Note that the propaganda
        term Happy Times is relative, taken in account the
        dangerous and extreme circumstances the U-boat crews were
        operating in.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">After ten nerve wrecking months of
        heavy losses, Bletchley Park succeeded in breaking into
        Shark. This was due to several different reasons. An
        important event was the attack on Kapitänleutnant Hans
        Heidtmann's U-559 by the British destroyer HMS Petard on
        30 October 1942. After taking heavy fire from HMS Petard,
        the sinking U-boat was boarded by three British sailors.
        They managed to get the Enigma code books and the new
        edition of the Wetterkurzschlussel. Two of them returned
        once more to recover the Enigma M4, but went down with
        the U-boat. They payed their bravery with their live, but
        not without result. This mission proved to be a turning
        point in breaking Shark. On 13 December 1942, more than
        ten months after the start of the black-out, Bletchley
        Park could finally inform the Admiralty again about
        U-boats positions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">After breaking a substantial number of
        messages, the codebreakers realized that the U-boat
        weather reports, encoded with the WetterKurzschlussel,
        were sent with the four-rotor Enigma in the less
        complicated M3 mode (the fourth rotor in A position with
        ring setting A). This was done to be compatible with the
        three-rotor Enigma M3, used on weather ships. The Bombes
        in Bletchley Park, developed to crack the three-rotor
        Enigma, took more than 20 days to crack the four-rotor
        Enigma key settings. However, a three-rotor key setting
        could be retrieved in less than 24 hours. This discovery
        was an enormous time profit. With the broken
        meteorological reports from Hut 10 and the recovered
        Wetterkurzschlussel they finally broke Triton
        continuously. When a new edition of the
        Wetterkurzschlussel came into service in March 1943, the
        seized U-559 Wetterkurzschlussel became useless,
        resulting in a new black-out. Fortunately, the
        Kurzsignalheft code book, also recovered from U-559,
        provided new ways to find cribs in U-boat short-signals
        and enabled the codebreakers to re-enter shark after nine
        days. Except for some brief periods, the codebreakers
        never lost Shark again.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Kurzsignale fail</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="../pics/kurzsignalheft.jpg"
        align="right" hspace="0" width="226" height="340"></font><font
        size="2">The U-boats used the Kurzsignalheft
        (short-signal book) to encipher contact messages. The
        Kriegsmarine converted default tactical expressions with
        a code table, called Kurzsignalheft, before enciphering
        them with Enigma. A contact with a convoy could for
        example be converted into UGKU, an enemy airplane into
        HKJL, or a meeting point for refueling into KLUG. More
        about these short-signals on </font><a
        href="kurzsignale.htm"><font size="2">Kurzsignale on
        German U-boats</font></a><font size="2">. The use of
        Kurzsignale seemed to be a clever approach. It was harder
        for Allied Signal Intelligence to trace these short
        messages with HDFD (High Frequency Direction Finding or
        Huffduff). Moreover, attempts to decipher these short
        messages didn't give any readable sentences, and
        approaching the correct key did not reveal pieces of
        normal sentences, helping to find the key settings. Also,
        the conversion of text into four letter codes shortened
        the cipher text. Less cipher text also provides less
        statistics to the code breakers. Nothing but
        advantages...they believed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Unfortunately for the Germans, the use
        of Kurzsignale resulted into recognizable patterns in the
        Enigma messages. A convoy, nearing a U-boat, would
        probably evoke a contact message. An airplane, spotting a
        U-boat, would result in a airplane contact message. In
        Bletchley Park, tactical information was linked to
        positions, obtained by HFDF and reconnaissance reports,
        to find out what type of message was sent by that
        particular U-boat. In combination with the recovered
        Kurzsignalheft code book, Bletchley Park was able to
        predict the content of the enciphered messages, thus
        providing them again with crucial cribs to feed into
        their Bombes. Meanwhile, new Bombes were developed to
        deal with the four-rotor Enigma. By June 1943, the first
        four-rotor Bombes came into action, and by the end of
        1943 another fifty four-rotor Bombes went operational at
        OP-20-G, the American Naval codebreakers. In the fall of
        1943, Shark messages were generally broken within 24
        hours.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">U-boats down</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The 'Ultra' information was extremely
        effective in the strategically very important North
        Atlantic Ocean. After the initial hard times, Bletchley
        Park broke the Enigma messages on a daily base. The tide
        of U-boat war was turned. Except for some brief periods,
        the entire German communication system was intercepted by
        a large number of listening stations called Y-stations,
        and the codes broken in Bletchley Park, with over 7000
        employees at its peak. With the positions of the U-boats
        unveiled, Allied ships were simply re-routed to avoid
        fatal confrontations with the U-boats, and an active hunt
        for the U-boats begun. The elite weapon of the
        Kriegsmarine became decimated, resulting in heavy losses
        among the U-boat crews. An estimated 700 U-boats and
        30,000 crewman were lost at sea. The German command
        related these losses to new detection techniques like the
        ASDIC sonar system, U-boat detection planes, and
        destroyers escorting convoys. This was partially a
        correct assumption, but they never suspected
        cryptanalysis of their Enigma encrypted radio traffic.
        The Enigma machine provided without a doubt a for those
        days unbreakable encryption. However, unsafe procedures
        and tactical mistakes turned the Enigma machine into the
        Achilles heel of the German war machine. Germany kept on
        using Enigma without any suspicion in all parts of their
        forces, which resulted in catastrophic consequences for
        Nazi Germany.</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Reality vs Fiction</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">Some books and movies, like Jonathan
        Mostow's &quot;U-571&quot; (fiction 2000) wrongly suggest
        the codebreakers were helped by captured Enigma machines.
        British and French Intelligence already received
        three-rotor Enigma replicas from Polish Secret Service,
        as early as 1939. In reality, the four-rotor Enigma and
        its internal wiring was obtained by cryptanalysis on
        intercepted messages and captured code books. The
        breakthrough in Shark was established without possessing
        an actual M4 Enigma. The secret and infamous U-boat and
        weather ship boardings were performed by the British
        Navy, and their primary goal was to capture the
        Kurzsignale, Wetterkurzschlussel and Enigma code books,
        and not to seize an Enigma machine. Although
        &quot;Enigma&quot; (fiction 2002), from Michael Apted
        with Dougray Scott and Kate Winslet is also historical
        incorrect, it gives a better technical view on the
        attempts to break into the Shark codes and how they
        worked in Bletchley Park.</font></p>
