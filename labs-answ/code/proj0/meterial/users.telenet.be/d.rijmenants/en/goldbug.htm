        alt="Original illustration for The Gold-Bug by Felix O. C. Darley"
        align="right" hspace="4" width="414" height="389"></font><font
        size="2">In 1840, Edgar Allan Poe wrote an article in the
        Alexander's Weekly Messenger, a Philadelphia newspaper,
        where he challenged the readers to submit their own
        substitution ciphers which he would decrypt. Initially,
        he received cryptograms from around Philadelphia, but
        soon after, they came in from all over the United States.
        He published many of the cryptograms and their solutions
        in fifteen numbers of the Alexander's Weekly Messenger.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The next year, Poe published his essay
        called &quot;A Few Words on Secret Writing&quot; in
        Graham's Magazine, in which he commented on the response
        to his cipher challenge (see download below). The essay
        also gave birth to the famous quote that &quot;human
        ingenuity cannot concoct a cipher which human ingenuity
        cannot resolve&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In the 19th century, most people
        considered secret writing and cryptography as a
        mysterious esoteric art, and Poe had sparked a great
        interest in cryptography with the general public. Thanks
        to Poe's publications, cryptogram puzzles became popular
        in newspapers and magazines. Inspired by the success of
        the cryptograms and the interest in his essay, he decided
        to write a short story that involved cryptography.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">After writing The Gold-Bug, he
        submitted the story to a writing contest, winning the
        grand prize and $100. The story was published on June 21,
        1843, in Philadelphia's Dollar Newspaper. It is regarded
        as the first important publication in popular
        non-technical literature that incorporated cryptography
        in its story line. The Gold-Bug contains a detailed
        description of how to solve a cryptogram using letter
        frequency analysis. The story was an instant success and
        helped popularize cryptography in the 19th century.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Edgar Allan Poe's The Gold-Bug is as
        iconic to cryptography in literature as David Kahn&#146;s
        Codebreakers is to historical publications on the
        subject. It became one of his most read and best known
        stories. Many readers have set their first steps in
        cryptology after reading Poe&#146;s story - some even
        became important codebreakers - and more than a few
        writers were inspired by Poe, to write their own story
        with secret writing and encrypted messages in it. </font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">The Story</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The main character in the story is
        William Legrand, a man who lives at Sullivan's Island,
        near Charleston, South Carolina, to escape from his
        misfortunes. Legrand discovers a brilliant gold-colored
        bug, but lends it out to someone else. When his friend,
        the narrator of the story, visits Legrand, he is told
        about the rare bug with a death's-head on its back, and
        Legrand draws him a picture of the bug on a piece of
        paper. A short while later, Legrand asks his friend to
        come visit him immediately. Upon the friend's arrival,
        the strangely behaving Legrand asks his friend to follow
        him on an expedition into the woods near some rocks, to
        search for a treasure. Afraid that Legrand has lost his
        mind, the friend decides to accompany him out of concern
        for Legrand's health. As it turns out, Legrand
        accidentally had discovered a secret message in invisible
        writing on the paper he used to draw the bug. Legrand
        later explains his friend how he found the message and
        how he was able to decrypt the message that started his
        quest for a hidden treasure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The cryptogram, as discovered by
        Legrand:</font></p>

        size="2">available here</font></a><font size="2">.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Gold-Bug is not only an exciting
        story about the discovery of an old treasure, but also a
        great introduction to cryptography and codebreaking. It
        tickles the reader's curiosity and Poe gives a detailed
        description of how to decipher the cryptogram. While
        doing so, he also provides the solution. However,
        deciphering the message yourself is even more exciting
        than reading how Legrand did it in the story. Can I
        challenge you, just as Poe did, to decrypt Legrand&#146;s
        message, composed more than 160 years ago?</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">Decrypting the Message</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">Rather than just reading Poe&#146;s
        story, I will show you the technique and give you the
        chance to do it all by yourself. It might be usefull to
        read </font><a
        href="../the_gold_bug.pdf"
        target="_blank"><font size="2">The Gold-Bug</font></a><font
        size="2"> first, as the story might provide information
        that will help to solve the cryptogram, <strong>but read
        only to where the cryptgram appears</strong>. Don't cheat
        by reading or peeking any further! Don't search the
        Internet for Poe or The Gold-Bug, as this will also spoil
        the fun. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The message is encrypted by
        mono-alphabetic substitution, a cipher where the letters
        of the alphabet are replaced by other letters or symbols.
        We can calculate all possible combinations for 26 letter
        of the alphabet, replaced by 26 symbols: the first letter
        is substituted by one of 26 symbols, the second by one of
        the 25 remaining symbols, and so on (26 x 25 x 24&#133;x
        3 x 2 x 1). In total, this gives
        403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 different ways to
        allocate 26 symbols to 26 letters. How on earth could we
        possibly decipher such a cryptogram? For centuries,
        substitution ciphers were regarded as unbreakable...but
        it is easier than it looks. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Although there are trillions of ways to
        allocate a set of symbols to letters, there are only a
        few ways to combine vowels and consonants in a natural
        language. Strict rules determine which letter
        combinations are possible and which are forbidden. The
        syntax prescribes in what order words should be written
        and which conjugations should be used. When we substitute
        letters with symbols, those symbols still follow all
        these rules and thus create patterns that we can detect.
        Just as certain letter combinations are impossible (ZLG,
        XOJ,...), so will certain symbols avoid one another. Just
        as it is evident that the same vowels will always fit
        within a given set of consonants (THR?ST, G??D...) so
        will attract certain symbols each other. But where do we
        start?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The mystery weapon to solve our message
        is letter frequency analysis, the basis of all
        codebreaking. Each language has its own typical
        distribution of letters in a text. In English, the letter
        e is by far the dominant letter, with an average of 12.7
        percent. If we locate some of the most frequent vowels or
        consonants in the ciphertext, or find recurring symbol
        combinations, then the rules of the language will give us
        strong leads to the words they are used in or the letters
        they represent. Below, you'll find the letters of the
        alphabet, ordered from most frequent at the left to least
        frequent at the right (Poe used an older and slightly
        different frequency table).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>E T A O I N S R H L D C U M F P
        G W Y B V K X J Q Z</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">For Legrand&#146;s message, start by
        taking a sheet with squares and write down the secret
        message with a pen. Leave some blank rows between each
        row of the message, to write your solution underneath the
        symbols with a pencil (easily corrected with a gum).
        Count how many times each of the symbols appears in the
        cryptogram and write down the results in a table, ordered
        from most to least frequent. You will see that one of the
        symbols clearly stands out. This is the first major clue.
        That most frequent symbol represents without doubt the
        most frequent letter of the alphabet. Write your first
        results underneath the according symbols on your message
        sheet.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Next, you try to spot recurring
        combinations of symbols. The most commonly used words in
        English are, in order of frequency: THE, OF, AND, TO and
        IN. Thus, you have to search for identical combinations
        of symbols that contain the most frequent letter you
        already found. You should spot each THE quite easily. If
        so, you have discovered the solution for two more letters
        that are used frequently. Make yourself a second table
        with all the symbols and their corresponding letters you
        already found.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">By now, you should be able to find more
        and more letters by completing fragments. If, for
        instance, you find a fragment T?EE, it is not hard to
        imagine what should follow the letter T. Vowels twins
        (AA, EE, OO&#133;) are common but not that many different
        words contain such pairs. Try to find those words. If you
        can&#146;t see it immediately, try all letters of the
        alphabet until you get something readable. Each new
        letter will help you to reconstruct more and more
        fragments. Be patient. It could take some time before a
        word appears in front of you, but once you have four or
        five letters, you&#146;re in a straight line to the
        finish.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Good luck...and make sure you don't get
        bitten by the bug!</font></p>
