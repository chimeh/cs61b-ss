<h3> Input/Output </h3><p>
<p>
<a name="io_redirect"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> What are the "standard output" and the "standard error"? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
Unix supplies programs with two <emph>streams</emph> of 
output to which they can write text.  These are called the <emph>standard 
output</emph>, which is intended for normal output, 
and the <emph>standard error</emph>, which is intended for error,
warning, or logging messages.  You should observe this convention in your
own programs, writing error messages to <tt>System.err</tt>.

<p>
From the point of view of a program, these streams
look like ordinary output files.  Various programming languages provide 
different notations and library calls to refer to them.  In Java programs, the 
standard output appears as the variable <tt>System.out</tt> and the standard
error as <tt>System.err</tt>.  Anything written to these (by, say, the 
<tt>printf</tt> method) comes out on the respective stream.

<p>
By default, both streams 
go to the terminal (or "console").  Unix shells provide
various ways of directing
them instead into separate files.  Unfortunately, the various
shells are inconsistent in how to do this. To run a command FOO (e.g.,
<tt>java solve test1.in</tt>), and send the output and error to various
destinations:

<table border=1 align=center>
<tr>
     <th>Desired effect</th>   <th>csh-like shell</th> <th>bash-like shell</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>  
      Std. output -> blah  <br>
      Std. error -> terminal
   </td>
   <td>   FOO &gt; blah   </td>   <td> FOO &gt; blah </td>
</tr>
<tr> </tr>
<tr>
   <td>   
       Std. output -&gt; blah <br>
       Std. error -&gt; blah
   </td>
   <td> FOO &gt;&amp; blah  </td> <td>    FOO &gt; blah 2&gt;&amp;1 </td>
</tr>
<tr> </tr>
<tr>
   <td> Std. output -&gt; blah1 <br>  
        Std. error -&gt; blah2
   </td>
   <td> (FOO &gt; blah1) &gt;&amp; blah2 </td>
   <td> FOO &gt; blah1 2&gt; blah2  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
You can also redirect the output of FOO to be the input of another command,
BAR:

<table border=1 align=center>
<tr>
     <th>Desired effect</th>   <th>csh-like shell</th> <th>bash-like shell</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>
      Std. output -&gt; BAR <br>
      Std. error -&gt; terminal 
   </td>
   <td>    FOO | BAR  </td> <td> FOO | BAR </td>
</tr>
<tr> </tr>
<tr>
   <td> Std. output -&gt; BAR <br>
        Std. error -&gt; BAR
   </td>
   <td>  FOO |&amp; BAR </td> <td>  FOO 2&gt;&amp;1 | BAR </td>
</tr>
<tr> </tr>
<tr>
   <td>  Std. output -&gt; BAR1 <br>
         Std. error -&gt; BAR2
   </td>
   <td> (FOO | BAR1) |&amp; BAR2  </td>
   <td> (FOO | BAR1) 2&amp;&gt;1 | BAR2 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
We use all this in the autograder to separate or combine the output and error
streams, as needed.

<a name="end_of_file"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> What is the "standard input", and what exactly does it mean to reach an "end-of-file" on it? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
There seems to be vast confusion about end-of-file in general.
The confusion 
arises from the fact that people have formed an inseparable link in their 
minds between keyboard input, the "standard input", and System.in (and are
unfamiliar with how to make keyboard input "end").  So here's a brief 
tutorial:

<ol>
<li> Analogous to what happens with standard output, all Unix programs are 
supplied with a standard stream of text input called the <emph>standard input.</emph>

<li> There are <emph>no</emph> necessary connections between keyboard input, 
   the standard input, and System.in except that <emph>by default</emph>, 
   the standard 
   input comes from the keyboard and System.in is <emph>by default</emph>
   the Java
   "handle" by which programs access the standard input.

<li> One can obtain the standard input from sources other than the keyboard
in Unix by using input redirection or pipes:

<ol>
<li> The command line

<pre>
         java foo &lt; SOMEFILE
</pre>

runs foo but takes the standard input from SOMEFILE (a file name) rather
than the keyboard.  This works for any command, not just 'java'.

<li> The command line

<pre>
         SOMECOMMAND | java foo
</pre>

runs SOMECOMMAND (any command) and java foo, taking the standard output
from SOMECOMMAND and using it as the standard input for java foo.
</ol>

<li> Although System.in by default gives a program access to the standard input
to the program, you can change this with

<pre>
        System.setIn (SOMEINPUTSTREAM)
</pre>

where SOMEINPUTSTREAM can be any Java expression that yields 
an InputStream, such as

<pre>
        new FileInputStream (SOMEFILENAME)
</pre>

or

<pre>
        new StringBufferInputStream (SOMESTRING)
</pre>

<li> You can, in fact, get end-of-file on keyboard input.  On our system by
   default, the character ^D (Control-D) signals the shell that it should
   send end-of-file to whatever program is reading from the terminal (the
   ^D is never transmitted).  However, you almost never want to do this.
   In general, your test input really ought to come from files, so that you
   aren't constantly retyping it.
</ol>

<a name="paths"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> I have some compiled Java code in a JAR file.  How do I get Java to 
load it? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
All classes loaded by a running Java program come from one of the locations 
indicated by the <emph>class path</emph>, which is a list of directories and
JAR (Jave ARchive) files.  JAR files, in effect, are directories full of files
all collected into a single ordinary file in such a way that the original
constituent files are easily found and extracted.
The Java runtime system looks for a class 
bar in package foo by looking at each item in the class path in turn.  If 
the classpath item is a directory, <i>D</i>, then Java looks for a 
file <i>D</i>/foo/bar.class
(reverse the slashes on Windows).  If the item is a JAR file, Java treats it
as a directory and again finds the desired class file (foo/bar.class) in it.
Typically, the current directory will be part of the classpath, although it
need not be.

<p>
Eclipse provides a "Java build path" window under Project->Properties.  The
Libraries tab on that window will give you an "Add External Jar" selection.
In plain UNIX, you add the Jar file to the CLASSPATH environment variable, 
which is a list of files separated by colons.

<a name="nested_classes"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> What are nested classes all about? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
Nested classes are "members" of the enclosing class, just as are
instance variables, constructors, and methods.  They may be public, 
private, protected, or package private (default).   The meaning of 
public, protected, etc., is exactly the same for classes as it is for
instance variables and methods: it determines where else in the program
you may mention the name of the member.

<p>
Static nested classes are just plain classes, like non-nested ones.  The
only thing that distinguishes them is where their names can be mentioned, 
and how they are referred to (class Nested inside class Enclosing is called
Enclosing.Nested).

<p>
Non-static (inner) nested classes are plain classes with one extra implicit
field.
For inner class Inner in enclosing class Enclosing, if E is an Enclosing,
then new E.Inner (...) is a pointer to a new object of type Enclosing.Inner
that has a private instance variable field called Enclosing.this, whose
value is E.   So, given

<pre>
    class Enclosing {
        String myName;

        Enclosing (String name) { myName = name; }

        public String toString () { 
           return "Enclosing named " + myName; 
        }

        Inner makeInner (String id) {
           return this.new Inner (id);  
           // OR return new Inner (id) for short ('this.' implied)
        }

        class Inner {
           String innerName; 

           Inner (String name) { innerName = name; }

           public String toString () {
              return "Inner named " + innerName + " connected to "
                     + Enclosing.this;
           }
        }

     }
</pre>

we could write (in some method somewhere):

<pre>
        Enclosing e = new Enclosing ("Tom");
        Enclosing.Inner i1 = e.makeInner ("Dick");
        Enclosing.Inner i2 = e.new Inner ("Harry");
        System.out.printf ("e = %s%ni1 = %s%ni2 = %s%n", e, i1, i2);
</pre>

and see printed

<pre>
        Enclosing named Tom
        Inner named Dick connected to Enclosing named Tom
        Inner named Harry connected to Enclosing named Tom

<h3> Java Language Issues </h3><p>
<p>
<a name="nested_class_this"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> Can nested classes use "this"? If so, what does it refer to? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
Nested classes are just classes, and <tt>this</tt> means the same thing in them
as it does in other classes: it applies in instance methods and refers
to the "thing to the left of the dot" in the call.  That's why we have
the odd syntax "Enclosing.this" for use in inner classes to distinguish
the "this's".  To make life confusing, Java will "helpfully" figure out
places where you "must have meant Enclosing.this" and supply it for you.
So if in an instance method of Inner, above, you had written

<pre>
        makeInner ("Jack")
</pre>

<p>
the Java compiler would assume that you must have meant to write

<pre>
        Enclosing.this.makeInner ("Jack");
</pre>

<a name="nested_private"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> Can an enclosing class access the private methods/variables of its
 nested classes? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
Yes.  The rule on private is "can only be used within the top-level
class containing its declaration," which must be (or include) the 
enclosing class.

<p>
<a name="method_lookup"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> When several methods have the same name, how does Java select which 
is called? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
In general, Java uses lexical scoping, just like Scheme.  That is, a
<emph>use</emph> of an unqualified simple name (i.e., an identifier that is not
preceded by '.') may refer to any declaration that's in a <emph>declarative
region</emph> (a class or interface declaration, a {...} block, a method,
a <b>for</b> statement, a <b>catch</b> clause, the source file, the package) that
contains that use.  In addition, package names in the anonymous package, 
classes and interfaces in the package <tt>java.lang</tt>, 
and imported classes and 
interfaces can sort of be thought of as being in declarative regions
that contain the use.  

<p>
For qualified names, SOMETHING.x, we look for 'x' only within SOMETHING
(which may be a package, class, or instance).  
For this purpose, we count inherited declarations as being in the class or
interface that inherits them.

<p>
So far, these rules will in general pick out several possible declarations,
as in the following <emph>completely legal</emph> declarations:

<pre>
     class A {
    //     a
        A A;
    //  1 b

        A A (A A) { return A; }
    //  2 c  3 d           4
        A () { }
    //  e
     }

     class B extends A {
    //               f
        void A () {
    //       g
           A A = A (new A ().A);
    //     7 h   8      9    10
        }
     }
</pre>

<p>
Here, I have marked each use of A with a numeral and each definition with a
lower-case letter.  

<p>
Initially, use #8 might refer to the declarations a (same file); b, c,
   or e (inherited by class B), g, or h.  First, however, we apply
   <emph>syntactic context</emph>: use #8 must refer to a method, because it is part
   of a method call.  Therefore, it refers either to declaration c or g.
   Overloaded methods are disambiguated by means of the argument list, so
   #8 must refer to c.

<p>
   Or consider #9. By context, it must refer to a class, which means
   declaration a, and a constructor within that class, which can only be
   e.

<p>
   Since the thing to the left of the dot preceding #10 is an A, #10 must
   refer to either declaration b, c, or e.  Since it is not a method call
   or constructor invocation, it must refer to b.

<p>
Sometimes, these considerations of context or argument lists are not
   sufficient, as in use #4, which might refer to either b or d.  In this
   case, we defer to the INNERMOST declarative region, which in this case
   is the method containing use #4.  That is #4 refers to d.  

<p>
Staticness has nothing whatever to do with any of this analysis.  Neither
does access level (public, private, etc.), with the exception that
private declarations are not visible outside their package, which may
cut down on the set of possible candidate declarations. (Other access
levels, such as default (package private) <emph>don't</emph> hide declarations;
instead you get errors about trying to access non-public things from
outside the package.  I consider this a small but annoying
inconsistency in Java).

<p>
Therefore, runtime selection of instance methods by dynamic type is a
separate mechanism, and does not participate in determining which
declaration the compiler applies to some use.  It is only when the
program is run that the system actually selects which method to call.
It will always be one that has the same signature as the one the
compiler selected.

<a name="equals_v_equalsequals"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> When I compare two strings with "==", I get unexpected results.  Why? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
The == operator always compares <emph>values</emph> for equality.  
Since the value of 
a String expression is a <emph>pointer</emph> to a String object, 
this means that ==
compares <emph>pointers</emph>, not the contents (character sequences) 
contained in the
objects pointed to.  You can construct the same contents two different ways,
and get two different objects with the same contents.  E.g.,

<pre>
   x = "Hello, ";

  "Hello, world" != x + "world"
</pre>
This is semantically consistent, but admittedly confusing.  Use the
<tt>.equals</tt> method instead:

<pre>
  "Hello, world".equals (x + "world")

<a name="warnings"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> What are these unchecked/unsafe operations that the compiler warns me
about? Should I worry about them? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
Yes, you should worry.  As a general rule, you should treat almost all
compiler warnings as if they were errors, because they <emph>might</emph>
be errors.  Warnings such as 
<pre>
    Note: foo.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
    Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
</pre>
in particular mean that you have a construct that cannot be checked until
execution time, whereas it is usually checkable at compilation time if the
program is written correctly.  If you do this:
<pre>
        ArrayList foo = ...
</pre>
instead of
<pre>
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; foo =
</pre>
for example, you'll get a warning.  You should correct all of these (our
pretests often require it, for example).
In almost all cases, you can correct them
without a problem.  For this project, you are likely to find a couple of 
instances in which you run into a limitation of Java and will have to 
use the 
<pre>
        @SuppressWarnings ("unchecked")
</pre>
annotation before a method or constructor.  In my project #2, I had two
on small methods.  If you
have any more than that, or if you have to attach it to an entire class,
you are probably doing something wrong.
<p>
The messages ask you to run javac like this:
<pre>
    javac -Xlint:unchecked foo.java
</pre>
as our Makefiles are set up to do.  This will give you more details.
In Eclipse, you should eliminate all the
little yellow warning flags.

<h3> Patterns </h3><p>
<p>
<a name="read_vs_string_escapes"> <div class="faq_question"> <b>Q:</b> When I read the input <code>\\(hello\\)</code> from the terminal into a String variable
and then use it as a Pattern, it does not match the String 
<code>"(hello)"</code>.  
Why not? </div></a>
<p>
<div class="faq_answer">
<b>A:</b>
[Kyle Wecker] 
The problem here is the difference between the way characters are represented
inside a .java file and the way they are recognized through streams (e.g.,
stdin). When you are typing into a string in a .java file, in order to show
that you mean '\', you must type "\\". The reason for this is that backslash is
an escape character that isalso used to signal a few other characters 
(like '\n').

<p>
Characters in a stream or reader, on the other hand, are read 
verbatim, without escape sequences.  So backslash is just backslash, and
two backslashes are just two backslashes. So, your example is really 
equivalent to the Java test <code>"(hello)".matches ("\\\\(hello\\\\)")</code>,
which is indeed false.   The argument to <code>.matches</code> here, coming
from a String literal, contains the characters backslash, backslash,  
left parenthesis, etc.&mdash;each pair of backslashes in the literal encodes a 
single backslash in the resulting String.

<p>
To make the confusion worse, backslashes have special significance in 
Patterns, too.  So the Pattern consisting of two backslashes could
be  input from
a file as two backslashes or else written as a String literal with four
backslashes, and is interpreted by the Pattern class as matching <em>ONE</em>
backslash!
