<h1> Quicksort Sorting</h1>

<p> 
Quicksort sorting is an <i>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</i> algorithm for sorting a list of
<i>N</i> items using comparisons that on average runs in <i>O(N</i> lg<i>N)</i>
time.  The idea is to reorganize the input sequence 
into two adjacent subsequences (<i>partitions</i>) such that all the
elements in the first partition are less
than all those in the second.  As a result, no further movement of items between
the two sections is necessary and the two sections can themselves be sorted
(recursively) independently.  We can continue this process, dividing the array
into smaller and smaller partitions that are all correctly ordered with respect
to each other.  
</p>
<p>
When the partition size is reduced to one the entire sequence will
be sorted.  However, the maximum partition size also limits the number of 
inversions in the sequence, which in turn limits the execution time of insertion 
sorting (see the <a href="insertion-sort-demo.html">Insertion Sorting</a> page).
The number of inversions in a sequence partitioned by quicksort is equal to the
sum of the numbers of inversions in the individual partitions (why?). 
Therefore, once the maximum partition size is reduced to some constant, the
total number of inversions is linear in the size of the entire sequence.
Since insertion sorting has better constant factors than quicksort, 
a common modification to the quicksort algorithm is
to apply insertion sorting once the maximum partition size is reduced 
below some predetermined threshold size.
</p>
<p>
To partition a sequence, quicksort chooses a <i>pivot</i> element from
the sequence and then swaps elements in the array to place elements
less than the pivot in the first partition and those greater in the
other. Each
partitioning operation requires linear time in the size of the
subsequence being partitioned. In the extreme case, the maximum
partitition size is reduced by one on each step, leading to
<i>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</i> running time.  The best case is to find pivots that
divide the
subsequence into equal-sized partitions.  There are various strategies
for choosing such pivots, including taking small random samples of the
subsequence. 
</p>
<p>
The variant presented here chooses as the pivot the median of the
first, last, and middle elements of a subsequence.  It switches to
ordinary insertion sorting when the maximum partition size is reduced
to a certain size, initially 4.
</p>
<p>
The partitioning steps use an
algorithm due to Nico Lomuto: the selected pivot is swapped to the
beginning of the subsequence to be partitioned, and the rest of the
array is swept, swapping elements less than the pivot to the left end
of the array (after the pivot).  As a final step, the pivot element is
swapped once more to the dividing line between the partitions, which is
its correct position in the sequence (why?).  Since it therefore need not
participate in further partitioning, any further partitioning operations
operate on strictly smaller subsequences (avoiding infinite recursion).
Each subsequence being partitioned is shown slightly separated from
the rest of the array, with elements known to be less than the pivot 
colored purple and those known to be greater than or equal colored
green.
