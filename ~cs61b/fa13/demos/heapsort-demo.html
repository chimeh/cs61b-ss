<h1> Heapsort</h1>

<p> 
Heapsort is a type of selection sort that sorts <i>N</i> items in
O(<i>N</i> lg <i>N</i>) time (worst case) using comparisons.
It first converts the input sequence into a 
a tree that satisfies the <dfn>heap property</dfn>&mdash;each node's value
is less than or equal to that of its parent.
Such trees are appropriately enough called <dfn>heaps</dfn>.
As a result of the heap property, the largest element in the tree will be at 
the root.
The algorithm repeatedly removes the largest 
element, replaces it with another value from the bottom level of the tree, 
and then re-establishes 
the heap property, thus forming the sorted array from the largest to the smallest
element.
</p>
<p>
In order to do all of this quickly, we represent the tree as a 
<dfn>complete binary tree</dfn>&mdash;each level of the tree is 
completely full, with the possible exception of the lowest level, all of 
whose nodes are located as far to the 
left of the level as possible.  Such trees have the nice property that we can 
store them sequentially in an array using a simple rule to find the children
and parent of a node: the parent of the node at index <i>k</i>&gt;0 in the 
array is at index &lfloor;(<i>k</i>-1)/2&rfloor;.  Likewise, the children of node
<i>k</i>, if present, are at indices 2<i>k</i>+1 and 2<i>k</i>+2.
The rightmost node on the last level of the tree is therefore the last element
of the array representation of the heap, and the root is the first
element.  
</p>
<p>
Complete trees must have a height that is bounded by lg <i>N</i>, where 
<i>N</i> is the number of nodes.  Furthermore, the heap property is 
sufficiently loose that when it is disturbed by replacing the root with another
value that violates the heap property, the heap property may be restored in 
time proportional to the height of the tree&mdash;hence the O(<i>N</i> lg <i>N</i>) time
bound for performing this restoration <i>N</i> times.   If a single node
in a heap violates the heap property with respect to its children, we simply
swap that node with its larger child, repeating this process as often as 
needed; it must perforce stop on reaching the leaves.  Establishing the 
heap property in the first place for an arbitrary complete tree is possible
in linear time:
we simply work backwards from the end of the array, swapping each node with its
parent if it is larger than the parent.
</p>
<p>
In the demonstration below, the portion of the array that is "heapified" is
shown in green, and the as-yet unheapified and unsorted elements are in 
pink.   Items that are being compared (parents with child nodes) are marked
with "V".
Once the
array is heapified, each step consists of swapping the root (largest) remaining
element of the heap with the last element of the heap (thus removing it from
the heap and placing it at the right point in the final array) and then
"reheapifying" as needed, swapping the new root downwards until the heap
property is restored.
